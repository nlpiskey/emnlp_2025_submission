# ACME: Robust and Explainable Detection of LLM-Generated Texts
This repository contains data for the EMLNP 2025 Industry Track submission `ACME: Robust and Explainable Detection of LLM-Generated Texts`. Each dataset is described below. For each dataset below, we do NOT train on this data, and only use it for evaluation purposes.

## Abstracts
The `abstracts.jsonl` file contains a balanced subset of 500 scientific abstracts generated by Mistral (both chat and non-chat version) from the RAID benchmark \href{dataset}{https://github.com/liamdugan/raid}. Note that we do not train on this data.

## Adversarial
The `adversarial.jsonl` file contains a balanced subset of 600 adversarial texts covering 10 attacks across all 8 RAID domains. 

## Essays
The `essay.jsonl` file contains a balanced subset of 200 essays from the following datasets
* [Essay Forum](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nid989/EssayFroum-Dataset)
* [Databricks Dolly](https://huggingface.co/datasets/databricks/databricks-dolly-15k)
* [Outfox](https://github.com/ryuryukke/OUTFOX)

## FDGPT Writing
The `fdgpt_writing.jsonl` file contains a balanced subset of 300 samples from the paper [Fast-DetectGPT: Efficient Zero-Shot Detection of Machine-Generated Text via Conditional Probability Curvature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05130) covering the following LLMs: Text Davinci, GPT 3.5, and GPT 4.

## M4 Peer
The `m4_peer.jsonl` file contains a balanced subset of 1000 samples where human data is extracted from top-tier publishing venues such as ACL, NIPS and ICLR and AI samples are stratified between generators such as bloomz, ChatGPT, Cohere, Davinci and Dolly. 


## Reviews
The `reviews.jsonl` file contains a balanced subset of 1000 Yelp reviews from the [Hugging Face Yelp dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Yelp/yelp_review_full). The corresponding AI texts were generated using GPT 4 via a proprietary prompt meant to preserve the length of and style of reviews, as LLM-generated reviews tend to be verbose.
