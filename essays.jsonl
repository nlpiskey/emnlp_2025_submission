{"id":0,"text":"Emotional intelligence is a critical part of our daily interactions and responses to situations. Recently, Dr. Huang's program which is supposed to detect people's emotions and attempts to desegregate these specific types of feelings has been developed. This program could be beneficial to schools in better supporting student well-being and perceived success. However, despite its apparent usefulness, given the overarching importance of good teaching methods like connection pedagogy and positive discipline, amongst others, there stands some drawbacks that need review before implementation. In function, Dr. Huang's program uses artificially organized maps and face-watching algorithms to detect emotions. Similar in performance to common interpretation mechanisms resident in humans, such as smiles as delight or scrunches of a passing over of mutual expressions, the machine divides sentiments into variants of \"happiness, sadness, surprise, disgust, anger, and fear.\" Effortlessly apparent expressions contain divisions within them, reducing as the effective detection chance goes down from big to miniature emotes. However, the program's mistake capabilities often lie in interpreting inner behavioral states, which differ significantly yet reliably inhabit external impressions. For customers who remained still and had a flat facial expression, computerized capable detection acquires been found less viable (\"50% recognition\" equivalent).

Most of the time they move schools because they don't like the rules in that school. If people are moving to another school then more and more will do the same and soon there will be no one in that school. They will close the school down and that school will be history.

If they cant go anymore they are missing more and more days then that is bad. They will get worse and worse each day they miss something because they did' t o to though classes on though days. Some student are going crazy or they are getting stressed out because they are trying to get their grades up. i think you should let them join sports. Even if they have a C for their average.

Even though there is a lot of students with a C grade average, I think this will make students work harder to bring up their grade so they can play in sports or activities again. I think the parents with children that have a C average think that they wasted their money on sports when the coaches are going to cut them off anyways. But i feel as though if they are going to do this, they should tell the parents and the students that they are going to cut them off because of their grade below a B so they could give the student a chance to bring the grade up. If they don't give the parents or students a warning about this there will be a lot of parents complaining. And nobody wants complaining parents because they could tell their friends with children that do play in sports that the coaches are just going to cut them off anyways, so why not just quit now so you don't feel embarrassing getting cut off.

The photograph appears to show a seemingly humanoid face engraved on Mars' surface, leading many to wonder if it was a man-made or a natural formation. Some believe that the anomaly was constructed by Martians, while others believe that the idea is a complete sci-fi hoax propagated by sensationalists. However, after analyzing the evidence and research surrounding the Face on Mars, it is plausible that it is nothing more than a natural rock formation. The images captured in 1976 and subsequent ones were taken with technology that doesn't offer ultra-crisp resolution when captured remotely. The technology was far more primitive compared to what we know today. Experts quickly pointed out that the so-called illusion is actually just a play of shadow and light. The limits of technology did not allow them to capture unique details that would have helped conclusively solving the mystery. Furthermore, subsequent images have revealed the object is rather deceptive. Photos taken by high-resolution space probes showed the \"face\" as a natural structure eroded into a surprising likeness of a human face. Besides, the slopes in those areas appear to be landed in random formations over the terrain. Making things more entertaining was the rash speculation suggesting how certain lights and specific angles on the imagery possibly indicated a Martian having fashion-forward thoughts. Regrettably this remains conjecture. With advancements in modern digital technology, this interpretation has come under scrutiny as newer images from high resolutions fall short in indicated it is anything but a trick of animation cast over the Martian landscape by light and shadow in the form of a familiar human last. Advocates of the theory of extraterrestrial life suggest a government conspiracy fabricating pictures to misdiagnose Ancient Alienes evidence. However, probe photographs made during different sun exposures of the same geographical characteristic did not fluctuate in anything.

For mainstream science then, this was an illusion that began melting away into obscurity years back. Given what appears pervasive atmospheric enhancement, images or colligation visited upon the photographed landscapes are highly unsupportable. Thus the \"Face on Mars\" stands testament to the intricate strategies of the mind when observing and rationalizing any image we see in our surroundings. In conclusion, multiple lines of evidence prove that the face on Mars is most definitely nothing but an optic illusion.

Thirty minutes pass, and I finally finish the rough draft of the lyrics to my newest track. \"If this paper be my canvas let my pen be my paint-brush, Conveyance is the key, but don't let my rhymes rush...\" I love to rap, freestyle, write, and produce. It is a way for me to voice my daily concerns, philosophies, and beliefs to the world. When I first arrived in upstate New York, there weren't any computer gaming rooms and subways. I needed to fill the void the absence of such conveniences left me. Hence, I began to record songs using my computer mic and Windows Movie Maker about Korea: how I missed the subway, the city life, and the after-school institutes I had to go to. Over the course of a few years, this passion developed from rapping about Korea to addressing problems in conventional hip-hop, recording from a laptop mic to a home studio. Today, rapping(for the sake of brevity), is much more than a hobby to me. It represents perseverance, freedom, and happiness and in a sense, it also represents me.

Even though there are several benefits to driverless cars, driverless cars can be a huge problem and danger to people, not just driving or riding in the car, but pedestrians outside of the car as well. I think driverless cars should not be allowed for several reasons. drivers could get more distracted, new laws would have to be made, and if an accident were to occur, the question that comes up is who should be blamed: the owner of the car, the driver of the car, or the car manufacturerer? Driverless cars could prevent accidents, but they could cause them just as much. it could lead to more accidents than a regular car. This is because if someone was tired when he or she was coming back home, they could potentially fall asleep because they are not driving. If this happens, the driverless car will not be able to get the attention of the driver to take over. when the driverless car is driving, the driver could get distracted by passengers or by their phones, causing them to not pay attention to the road because they are texting or playing a game or, even worse, not be able to listen to the driverless car when it is telling the driver to take over due to the passengers having a conversation with each other or the driver. if driverless cars were to be allowed, it would cause several other issues, like the making of new laws. I also agree with another point that the text rose. If someone were to get in an accident with a self driving car, who would be to blame: the driver or the manufacturer? I think that driverless cars are just too dangerous to make leagal. Driverless cars would be the cause of hundreds of car accidents that takek place on the streets everyday, with no one to point the finger at. Driverless cars are not just an issue and danger to the driver, but also the passengers inside the car and pedestrians on the street. There are several other dangers as well. With driverless cars, the driver may get bored of not driving and accidentally fall asleep, and will not be able to wake up when the car tells the driver to take over.","label":"human"}

Such activities include involvement in sports, music, debate, volunteerism, and clubs, beyond the regular academic curriculum. These are not only fun and enjoyable, but entail key benefits to students beyond regular academic achievements. Participating in such activities boosts energy levels, improves health outcomes, social skills, and helps the student frame their focus and attain better school engagements. In this essay, the benefits of extra curricular activities- in sports, debates, clubs, or volunteering, and their link to improved focus, engagement, and health among students are illuminated for a clear understanding. One of the benefits of participating in extra curriculars is that they enhance brain function and unique abilities. Physical lively movements involved in playing football, basketball help students develop agility, reactive ability, coordination, and overall brain function ( Best, Shiozawa, VanHook, & Huettel, 2010). Similarly, music, art, and dance skills bring about creativity, imagination, emotional control in the brain's functioning being associated with reasoning and motivation brings individuals who take part creative intelligence and improved brain convenience, improving One's problem- solving ability which certainly comes in handy with collaboration or while undertaking challenging tasks. Apart from that, students that are professionally trained in extra curricular activities like music and debates tend to speak fluently, creatively buy itself, feeling wholesome, and sensitive (Brooker&Morgan 2006 cited Kern's, 1993). Such engagements require well-refined presentations on various related topics, coherent and constructive argument presentation, motivational speaking in the presentation of interesting, educative ideas, knowledge learnt from memories, tactfully managing questions are likewise some vision and confidence he can implement regarding self-other relationship.

The only problem I have with that idea is that I feel that some students will feel bad for being left out even though a C is average. I also think that there should be no way to be knocked out of track. I say this because everyone is always talking and thinking about obesity. This is not like football or basketball or any other sports like that. The reason being is that the main reason people run track is either to lose weight or to get fit. I know what you are thinking. you are thinking, why can't they run on their own. It takes a lot of motivation to get out and run on your own. I know this because I run a good bit. It was a lot harder to get myself going, mentally and physically when I started than it is to now.

I, myself, didn't realize that until today. As I would like to describe myself, I am the kind of girl who cannot be defined. I dare to be different; an enthusiast of many things. I take passion from the very nest of my soul and apply it to my interests. Furthermore, I am an appreciator of life and its goodness. Furthermore, I am an amateur writer, aspiring musician, abstract doodler, gun shooting rookie, and intellectual geek. Furthermore, I also like to think that I am an advice giver. Furthermore, I dream to be an inspirational figure to the youth, and most of all, to be the best I can be. Furthermore, I am more than grateful to say that I am now healed. The trials and errors in the past have helped shape me into a better and happier person I am today. Starting with, I spent my childhood life in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Having lived there helped me learn to adapt to different kinds of foreign cultures. I have become friends with different races, tasted various kinds of Western dishes, and heard a whole new range of music that may or may not be the same with my very own taste. Despite having exposed to a diverse kind of society, I still managed to put up with my own customs and traditions. My parents raised me to be familiar with my motherland that is the Philippines. I have the likeness and traits of a pure Filipino. Growing up, I had my downfalls just like anybody else. Experiencing depression at an early age, I have committed the mistake of not believing in myself. I let my failures leave a negative effect on me, instead of using them to accomplish better change. I had always thought that life generally sucked, but I discovered what false statement that is. Furthermore, I remember my father's message to me, \"If you just look around you are more blessed than most, so be happy and enjoy life. Sometimes obstacles and failures need to frustrate us, so we could learn to think of ways to go through it. It yields a smarter and stronger you in the future.\" I couldn't agree more to this statement. I learned to overcome the state I had been in, as I finally let the light of positivity flow into the very core of my heart. Furthermore, I'd woken up from my false beliefs big thanks to the people who have always been there by my side. This has been a learning curve for me. As I see myself now, I knew that these experiences have well paid off. In school, I've always been a consistent honor student. Even having encountered problems relating to other things, I am proud to say that I have never failed to commit myself into my studies. I have natural interest in learning. This has helped me acquire the status of being Valedictorian. My parents held a celebration party for me the very next week after graduation. I must say that I have never felt real good before, because on that day I actually felt people gave me recognition. Because of that, I continued striving more not just on my studies, but also on other things I could be good at. New interests piled up, soon I wanted to learn more things and become engrossed in them. I also learned a lot with my past relationships with some people. People do come then leave. In my younger times I didn't know how to feel about that. I couldn't really remember how we all grew apart, but I noted to myself that these people had all left me lessons. It's also pretty absurd to think that I had been once a people-pleaser. There were just times I got too far being the nicest one, and now I have realized that it's not a very smart way to deal with people. I mean, why would you let yourself be the national doormat that anyone could just step on? C'mon, that's just cruel! It was crazy, but that was just because my old, naive self didn't know any further. Just a year ago, we moved back to the Philippines. I never would've thought that it could be such a life-changing decision! Having to be in a new social atmosphere has helped me greatly to become a more productive person. I met lots of incredible, thought-provoking people who have inspired me to no extent and discovered different kinds of views and opinions I never would have been exposed to. I have become more spoken of myself and my opinions. In the near future, I see myself as a professional medical doctor. I would like to try to cure the incurable. I am very much interested with all the works of being a doctor. Personally, I want this because of the satisfaction and gratitude I could get from it. I do promise to myself, if I become a doctor I'd still try to give myself enough time for other things. If time would allow, I'd be a part-time musician. I know from my heart and in my soul that if I didn't get to pursue a career in medicine, I'd get a music career. Of course, to get my dream job I need to get to college first. And that's exactly what I'm going to do. I believe that a prestigious school like Stereo de Manila University will help me reach my goals and help me discover more what I can offer.","label":"human"}
{"id":15,"text":"Why is it better to get advice from multiple people to help someone make a better choice? It's important to get multiple opinions from anyone because you can have more open options and have a idea on what would be better for you in the future and you wouldn't feel helpless and depressed no matter what the situation your in. When getting advice from someone you would probably play it out in your head and ask yourself, is this the best choice for me? Asking yourself what option would positively help the outcome of my situation. In that case your gonna need\/want multiple advice from different people. Then, you would want to think how that might effect your future in the long run. You wouldn't want anything bad to happen between you or someone just because it helped you in the end. Try and solve the problem by understanding yourself and that other person,like you would want good outcomes for both of you and for no one to be hurt. After,your gonna want to know that that was the best choice for you so that the situation was completely resolved. It might effect somethings good or bad. But in that way you would learn from it and know that maybe that certain option wasn't the best to fit your needs. Open and multiple opinions are always gonna be better than having one because there will always be a better chance of having a problem figured out. Most people these days suffer from depression because they think they don't have anyone to turn to and nothing is gonna help them in anything they're caught up in. Opening up and talking to people can re leave that feeling. Asking people for help and advice on what to do. First,asking others for options would make the situation less stressful and you wouldn't have to feel alone. Sometimes when you do have more than two or three ideas, those ideas can surprisingly make a better impact on the situation. You have better ways to see the outcome because of that opinion you followed through with. All together,the situation can be resolved or it won't have to be a big deal like it was before that made you feel uncertain. All those opinions and advice you took can make your life so much easier and make you feel less worried. Taking the advice,using it, and letting it help you and the situation can take off any negative energy you felt towards yourself. You can be unbothered and be happy that you no longer have to take care or think of what you had to go through. So basically letting other people help you and your needs can take off so much stress off you shoulders and you wouldn't have that feeling of being empty all the time because you have no idea on what to do or if anything can help at all. So because asking people for multiple opinions and seeing how it can effect your future and feeling less stressed or depressed, there will always be a better chance for you to make a better choice and have almost anything solved. It's better to have help from others and not just ask yourself all the time for advice that would probably stay the same. You need to have different ideas and thoughts to play out so you have a higher chance for something better.","label":"human"}

If you tell students to read when they have free time that's not really free time because they're still working. I will give you some reasons why i think that policy 1 is better then policy 2. One reason why policy 1 is better is because if you tell students to read a book when they have free time they won't want to do it because they've been working all day. So if students don't want to do something they're not going to do it. Most of the time when you tell students to do something they don't want to do they start disrupting class and getting in trouble. Another reason is because students do it without permission anyway. So giving them the right to have their phone out during free time will help a lot of people stay out of trouble. This would be a good policy to make because almost everyday people get their phone taken away for pulling it out during class. If you make policy 2 a rule it won't make a difference because students are still going to do it anyway So you would be way better off with making policy 1 a rule. Policy 1 would stop a lot of people from getting their phone taken. The last reason i can think of is students might actually do their work so they can have their phone out. I believe that will pull up a lot of students grades. hope you decide to choose this policy because i think it would really help students bring up their grade and stay out of trouble.","label":"human"}

No other college that I'm applying to is asking me about my favorite books and music, or has abstract essay prompts like guessing what is between living and dreaming (I love the Play-Doh to Plato one a lot as well). One thing I've always looked forward to about college was abandoning a strict, highly objective class setting. Being able to play around with ideas and share them at leisure while being productive is something Chicago encourages, and I was especially excited when I read about the Socratic style in which classes were taught.

Additionally, as facial recognition technology still has significant limitations, the program would rely on outsiders or a few select professions to make evaluation decisions. Plus, these biased evaluations could direct students toward both politically, socially influential jobs or under-funded and unpleasant jobs. Considering all aspects of such a program, we do not think schools should implement face recognition systems until thorough testing and verification have concluded, including emerging issues concerning equity in machine learning. Until there is congruous evidence for its safety beyond doubt, students' education and unconventional assessments depending solely on individual distinction-distinguishing need reassurance and robust security built by using permission rules as laws with close","label":"ai"}

{"id":20,"text":"In Nietzsche's, \"On the Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense\" Nietzsche explains his attitude towards human scientific knowledge with great skepticism, even alluding to humans as \"the most arrogant and mendacious\" creations (On Truth and Lying in an Extra-Moral Sense, 7). This same sort of criticism is brought up in the concept of \"the god-trick\" in Haraway's, \"Situated Knowledge: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective.\" Haraway explains this concept as an illusion within which humans compare their own knowledge to the idea of infinite knowledge to that of a god. This sort of intellectual superiority has been a long-standing concept in human history as we have progressed in scientific thought. Described initially in Haraway's writing, \"the god-trick\" remerges in many ideas Nietzsche exemplifies this through various metaphors and explanations of biases through perceptions. This idea of the \"the god-trick\" and its qualities of knowing all, stem from humans and their rigid minds, being able to grasp only at what is tangible in their own minds, consequently shutting out other perspectives. Humans approach scientific discovery with a biased view, through their own one-sided viewpoint, and through no fault of their own make scientific discoveries which come from their own observations. But it isn't at this point where human faults are exemplified, Nietzsche argues, rather when scientific discovery is built upon these so-called\n\"scientific truths.\" It is at this point in time where in a moment notice the concept of science could \"swell up like a balloon at the slightest puff\" because of the very construct of scientific advancement based on falsities (On Truth and Lying in an Extra-Moral Sense, 7). Yet, given the knowledge of how fallible so many human discoveries have the potential to be, we still hold on to the idea of superior credibility which can be challenged by no force in our world, in essence, what Haraway refers to. In her idea of the \"the god-trick,\" Haraway advocates for a different way we approach observations through a different approach to objectivity. In separating ourselves from the almost seemingly personal obligation of being able to understand anything and everything and accepting the complexities of science we are able to remove the idea of false compromise on scientific truths to make up for our lack of understanding. A fundamental idea that is exemplified in Nietzsche's writing, is the idea of pride. Pride is a large component of human behavior and many actions are justified. The concept of pride can even be seen as an answer to the implied questions of where the root of the \"god-trick\" is derived from. From the beginning of time, it can be observed that we humans have had an itch for the idea of conquering. An itch to conquer societies, cultures, land, or even something as simple as higher socioeconomic status. It's quite simply in our blood and has been present for generations of humans. Furthering Haraway's argument, Nietzsche presents the idea of how being prideful in the depth of our \"knowledgeable\" we are \"blinding fog over the eyes and senses of men'' exemplifying how pride can produce scientific thought that provides answers just for the sake of answering questions that in reality are faulty (On Truth and Lying in an Extra-Moral Sense, 7). As a result of this, a curtain of deception is created in which humans have assisted in the creation\nof their lies which to them have been converted into truth. Scientific discovery from this point on leads to \"truth\" being built upon from lies. Turning a blind eye is a large theme within the idea of \"the god-trick\" and is iterated upon in Nietzsche's description of the \"leaf.\" The leaf is a broad example of this created by \"disregarding... differences and forgetting distinguishing aspects\" (On Truth and Lying in an Extra-Moral Sense, 24). What is described here is that humans cannot label an \"essential quality\" for anything they describe. In essence, it is understood that there are many different types of leaves but we are not able to explain the explicit differences among them and in doing so what arises is a lack of \"truth'' with the leaf. The fault lies in the generalization of the leaf and applying this generalization to other contexts is where the fault lies, which is exactly what Haraway addresses in her \"god-trick\" illusion. The very definition of \"the god-trick\" includes generalizing our own knowledge to compensate for the holes in our discovery and knowledge. Through years of scientific advancement and gain in understanding our world, the so-called truths that humans have established may have faults resulting from the way the scientific method approaches them. Haraway suggests that our way of utilizing objectivity needs to reworked to be more inclusive and Nietzsche's writings extend upon this idea and exemplify how these truths may have fault in them as a result of assumptions. These assumptions built on top of each other lead to the lack of understanding that both authors argue.","label":"human"}
{"id":21,"text":"In the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming,\" the author describes where the cars are now and how they are effecting society. Even, after reading the passage, I don't believe that driverless cars should be a reality right now. Maybe in a few years, when changes are made for safety precautions, but in the now, we can handle driving on our own. Having the \"smart roads\" equipped with electrical cable or magnets, as General Motors and Berkeley engineers did in paragraph 3, would never work with rebuilding all new roads all over the world just for these cars. Imagine the time and money spent just for these roads to be built. And what will happen once the passengers are on a road without these \"smart\" adaptions? Because of this, the next version of this driverless car is to rather equip the car with sensors and not the road itself as the Toyata Prius did in paragraph 4. But no matter how many sensors, lasers, or recievers you have on this driverless car, artificial intelligence will never be as smart as human intelligence. What will happen when a deer jumps out from a field, a pedestrian rides his bike, a child's ball bounces out from her yard, or a pothole comes near comes bouncing from her yard? Will the sensors and lasers notice the change and react as fast a human would? Even if there is still a driver in the seat, as said in paragraph 8, what will keep their attention on the road and not fixated on their phone or other passengers? No amount of buzzing or flashing lights will get the attention of the driver to whatever accident may occur quick enough to make a change. If anything, the displays will make the driver panic in such a way that will make their safety decline further. Driverless cars are especially targeted to keep those who would normally drive while under the influence of alchohol and others safe from them. But once again, what if something should come between the car and where the car wants to go? The \"driver\" under the influence of alchohol cannot to anything otherwise, especially with the displays distracting the driver further. Without these driverless cars those under the influence would normally grab a taxi or ride home with a friend, but with the driverless cars, he\/she would be a potential threat. having driverless cars in the world would not be nearly as safe as human intelligence. The driverless cars will be more of a distraction on to the passengers and essentially, will not help any of the passengers nor pedestrians around them. There are much too many scenarios that could go wrong rather than if a human driver was actually in control.","label":"human"}

That said, students often have the liberty and freedom to choose their own summer assignments, which in most cases, lead to unequipped preparation. In contrast, it is imperative that teachers design summer projects as it ensures that the students achieve the required academic standards along with principal factors like familiarizing themselves with their teachers' style of teaching, staying consistent with in-time production, and enhancing their work ethic. Thus, evident of teachers designing summer projects and its positive responses cancels out any doubt surrounding ambivalence. For starters, designing summer projects by teachers helps to prepare first-year students or introduce returning students to new faculty members and the teaching for the upcoming starting school. Beginners, in particular, may have many questions regarding the curriculum or how teachers teach topics; by designing well-organized summer projects, doubts can be cleared, standards can be started, it, in turn, saves time in consequent the year. As per a high school counselor \"one year, English teacher Clark Polly required her forthcoming incoming sophomores to read War and Peace over the summer and 'Photo diary of medium underdog' point out, \"analyzing her students' understanding of this notoriously challenging book throughout the year became a barometer for how her classroom would operate\" (Garfield). Thus, this interesting fact spreads energy filled with curiosity and pupils enjoy discovering things in a useful mindset thus not undermine efficiency in their learning. In addition to detailed knowledge of the teacher's style in instructional format, summer projects built provides a good opportunity, particularly for students seeking to apply research techniques, timekeeping methods. Additionally, strategy management and life skills develop emotional intelligence can all happen through attachments, essays e.g., identified Service Learning or volunteering projects.

{"id":25,"text":"Making decisions is a ubiquitous aspect of our lives. Some can be trivial, while others can be complex and have a significant impact on our future. In an attempt to make excellent decisions, we seek advice and opinions from a range of sources. While relying only on our judgment and reasoning power helps us achieve quickly arrived at decisions, using multiple people's opinions and advice brings a new and nuanced perspective to our thinking. In this essay, we will explore the benefits of using multiple people's opinions when making decisions while outlining various ways that incorporating different perspectives can improve decision-making abilities. One of the principal benefits of using multiple people's opinions and advice when making decisions is the opportunity for broader communication and higher creativity. Bringing diverse views to a certain point sharpens communication and thinking that could become eroded if narrowly conceived - which allows others to express thoughts easier regarding how the problem exists. With interdisciplinary problem-solving amonking individuals with skill sets unlike your own, innovation thrives as conflict resolution remains effective. Brainstorming requires individuals looking at varying perspectives and working on distinct methodologies to fix a challenge. Because of this, reliance on several assertive individuals carrying the weight of the decision partly ensures the problem addressed securely. Another key advantage of gathering opinions from multiple people is that when they are shared with empathy, it provides exposure to different viewpoints, and provides the capability to critically analyze diverse factors that take part in decision-making. By listening to different ideas and opinions, your perspective of a single situation is broadened, and through critical analysis and consequential merging of thoughts, an effective solution is being created with expansive development. Furthermore, acquiring multiple people's opinions and advice contributes to making an informed decision.

But they were only allowed to vote if they had certain papers to allopw saying they are citizens. The way that it works is that each person running has a group of electors and is counted by the congress to find out who is winning in the campain. It consiswts of 538 electors,majority of 270 of the electoral votes are required to elect the president your state entittled allotment of elctors to help in the campain. They get one in the house of represntivies and two senators. I think that keeping the electoral college is what we need nothing is wrong with the system since our fore fathers were around so why change it now It says that each canidate has the option to pick his\/her electors to be in for the election. Then on every fourth year after the first monday in november on tuesday the president is elected. But before they get there they go to each state saying there speeches and hopin that the majority of that state votes for them because most states use a \"winner takes all\" were if you get the majority you get the whole states vote. But if thats not enough then maybe this is why we should keep the electoral college. Even if Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole,and the U.S chamberer of comerce say its wrong and Al Gore. i think it should stay because it was the best and easiest way to figure out who should be elected for president\/vice president But these speculaters dont understand that they are choosing the president and the electors before the vote of the president. They only see it happen one time since 1888 and everything goes crazy becuase gore was more popular and bush had more electoral votes and bush won even if gore was more popular. In 2012 when obama was elected over romney with a 61.7 to 51.3 because that almost all the states were using the electoral college all or nothing. In order for that one canidate to be elected the person needs to have a trans-regional vote for say romney only had the south thosw are not enough votes to win over the north and south. The canidates are mostley going for the \"swing states\" because they listen to the whole campain and decide who they think deserves it through there campain. Larger staes get way more attention becasue they are worth more points to the election. They try to avoid run off elections because they are shot out of the water that way with casts as low as the mid 40's in percentage. Thats why i think the elctoral college deseres to stay. Not because al gore got mad cause he was favorite and still lost but over all i think that just because thats omething bad happend one time does not mean that the whole thing has to go down in flames.

In essence, schools across the world stipulate that students necessitate obtaining a C-average to participate in sports. Others set exclusivity criteria by only allowing sportsmen or women to take part if of exceptional scholarly quality satisfactory for university entry.

This has entailed cutting back on different sporting activities to allow sufficient attention to grades, leaving students in the unenviable position of obtaining high grades as well rival or forget playing sports entirely.

{"id":35,"text":"For the purpose of this assignment I will begin by defining \"power\" and I will look upon my own experiences of how power operates and affects my life. We can define power as the possession of control or command over others; authority; ascendancy: power over men's minds. This definition is strongly contradicted by Foucault who argues in the History of Sexuality Vol.1 that power is something which is performed, something more like a strategy than possession. Power should be seen as a verb rather than a noun, something that does something, rather than something which is or which can be held onto. In theory power and powerlessness are two actions which are closely linked together, consequently; when one person gains power causes another person to lose it. This is strongly contradicted by Foucault. As we know there are inequalities in our society which can occur on a personal level or structural level. To have a better understanding of power we need to look at how power is distributed in our society. Foucault refers to power to be in a fluid form. In (Mills, 2003) Foucault ideas are expressed in a more clear way. He refers to power as present even in situation where people may feel powerless. Foucault argues that powerless people can exercise power although at the time they may not realize it. The experience which am I bringing below it will give an excellent insight into how power operates and is distributed. It will also touch upon the subject of privilege. I will talk about one issue in which I believe power plays a significant role. It is very difficult to express in few words the obstacles encounter in a foreign country. As a refuge I have seen first hand how difficult life can be in various moment and different circumstances. Married for some time I find myself in a difficult position where I feel as much powerless as I do powerful. My husband is also a refuge awaiting decision whether he can stay or not in the United Kingdom. Although we have a family together he does not enjoy the same rights as I do. He lives a conditional life which affects all of us. While I have the advantage to live work and study in the United Kingdom my husband conducts a restricted life. He has no right to work, travel anywhere outside England or study. This is a classic example in which I can apply the knowledge I have gained in this module. Connecting this part of my life to power and privilege I can understand how power can shift very easily from on person to another. A good example would be this situation. I am powerful in taking the decision to either follow my husband in his country or not. At the same time taking any decision renders me powerless. By choosing to follow my husband I chose to remove my daughter from the chance to have a happier life with more opportunities. On the other hand choosing to stay I deprive my daughter of having both her parents to raise her. With this personal experience I can rely to being powerful and powerless, and I can rely also on privileges me clearly possess but do not recognize their importance on everyday life. It is clear to me how privileges which I possess may go unnoticed but when I compare my situation with that of my partner I can clearly appreciate my privileges. As a person who enjoy the right to live freely in the United Kingdom and chose her own path I can appreciate the privileges which I currently possess like being able to get an education, look into a carrier or little things like travelling, holidays, choose the area in which I live, the right to have a say by voting and so on. I also realize that I become powerless in relation to procuring a steady life for myself and my family Jan Took who is a social worker and an author of many social work books has very strong postmodernist views. Took (2002, 46) talks about how people can be empowered although at times they might not actually realize their power. \"People do not fit easily into powerful or powerless groupings, sometimes having membership of both at the same time. As well members of powerless groups do not necessarily agree on the form of their empowerment.\" Fook (2002, 47). Jan Took also talks about Another incident I would like to bring is when I was pregnant with my daughter. On the first appointment with my midwife I found myself feeling overwhelmed and stressed due to the way I was approached by the midwife. She asked why I was living in the United Kingdom and not in Albania. To keep an easy atmosphere I smiled politely hoping she would understand that I was more interested in knowing about my pregnancy rather than talk about my circumstances. She kept pressing on more questions which were not related neither with my wellbeing nor pregnancy. I try to explain to her that I was more interested in learning about my baby. Her attitude suddenly changed, and she started to speak to me in broken English. She also started to use hands to show me things in book. When asked what I was doing as far as employment I explained to her that I was taking an access course to Higher Education. I hoped this would have indicated to her that I could speak good enough English for her to feel more relaxed in our communication. By the end of that visit I felt very much patronized and offended. Suddenly I was reminded of many encounters where people presume that I can not speak English or my understanding is very basic. This is often the attitude which is offered to me where people are judgmental and patronizing. Reading about postmodernism has helped me to realize that there is no one reality for all but that there are many realities. Postmodernism places an emphasis on fragmentation, diversity, multiplicity and contextualize. According to Took 2002 power is as much a good as it is a bad thing. Different context may influence the type of power how is practiced and exercise (Healy, 2000;45) Took, 2000 goes on to talk about power by expressing that some form of power can be accessible to every person regardless of their status. The distribution of power than differs depending on each context, and changes of context.","label":"human"}
{"id":36,"text":"The world is rapidly changing and so is the education system. Owing to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, students are facing a lot of inconvenience while attending traditional in-person classes. As a way around, online classes where students can attend their lectures via video conferencing from their homes were rapidly adopted. Online courses come with numerous advantages, including convenience, flexibility, comfortable home learning environment and the ability to attend lectures from any geographic location. Nonetheless, some anecdotal objections have also been highlighted, including the reduction of student-teacher\/peer interaction, procrastination, cheating, distractions like easily switching from the video conferencing window to Facebook or Netflix as well as differences in online course quality. My essay explores the benefits of studying at home from attending online classes, focusing mainly on accessibility and convenience while highlighting the limitations while proffering tip on how such limitations can be navigated, towards effective blissful learning experience. One of the significant benefits of attending classes online at home is increased convenience. Accessing education material remotely reduces the time and expense associated with traveling to a learning institution. Therefore, instructors can quickly deliver lectures, and scholars can attend them from any location. Besides, it frees up time for students to follow other passion or line of interest. Additionally, students recovering from different forms of illnesses or undergoing prolonged medical treatments such as surgery, vaccinations, allergies, and rehabilitation, technological advancements present better learning opportunities. They can quickly attend remote classes minimizing physical\/contact spread risks, even without the need to jeopardize their conditions. One consideration area while attending virtual lessons' to sick and out of state student email and the suggestion box of virtual management toolbox will be lauded. Similarly significant is the comfort associated with taking classes from the home environment because students learn and captivate control of learning routines. Studying at home entails the learner has greater mastery over stimuli interaction, customized refreshments, less attractive opportunities involving distraction, etc. : meaning that highly optimal, quiet, consistent learning process facilities available at home creates attuned learners developing towards professional directions. That being said, online learning also presents several drawbacks, e.g., limited interaction between instructing teachers\/ teaching assistants and counterpart peers might reduce a sense of belonging and limit the continued dynamic feedback which otherwise happens where interaction continuity flourishes, especially for people who like t, interact. Online absence poses a hindrance that impedes public feedback on critical components for effective submission delivery. Education rests not just the submitted context-based problem-solving inputs; properly analyzing other people's comment means cultivating and honing agreeable behaviour skills inherently rooting intended positive thinking. Also, unmotivated students can chronically switch to distract the readily available -Netflixing-bounty-free or drowsiness-type availability zones of household relaxation at its passive best. Many theories have been built why student prefers engaged instructional time in public, circumstantially underlining less actual problems within a session actively taught around peers in upbeat scenarios. An example of how tutors through virtual distance communication relate; bringing relevance, or a moderator-moderator relatedness that poses immediate discussion monitoring-free for inspiring debates intimately propels attention. Undeterred, online courses too can be rendered to equip compete with the one supposing colleges, universities and classrooms define educational lustro look.

{"id":37,"text":"I am enrolled in the International Baccalaureate program-a program dedicated to rigor and probing inquiry. When presented with the option of either becoming an Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate student the question for myself was clear: which one allows an outlet for discussion and reflection? Taking into account that both are weighted courses and considerably challenging, it is often difficult to dissect and differentiate between the two. I knew for myself that a challenging course for the sole sake of challenge is unacceptable. I found belief in a challenging course for the sake of satisfying one's intellectual appetite only natural-learning for the sake of learning. IB has provided this for me, offering classes which entertain atmospheres of open discussion and critical thinking. We are encouraged to set aside politically correct mindsets, and instead put fourth genuine and thoughtful conceptualizations. While always safe and inoffensive to merely fade back into what is accepted and unchallenged, it can be most assuredly understood as unproductive and stagnant. University of Chicago, as I understand is also in favor of providing its students with learning styles of Socratic Method. The approach taken to gain knowledge through edifying discussion and debate is a refreshing accommodation and tradition at Chicago. These approaches to learning are what I believe to be timeless and liberating, but most importantly crucial in establishing a foundation for which a truly reflective and vivacious community can flourish. This foundation supports a community of intellect, which in turn supports a future of promise; all three interlocking to construct a sincere institution of knowledge. I seek to be a part of the thoughtful and ongoing discussion that is Chicago. (Caleb Gods)","label":"human"}

It is no wonder that teenagers use these devices as an extension of their minds and promoting these in schools should be praised. The arguments in favor of cellphones outweigh their potential effects on education since they radically transform everyday life by increasing learners' motivation and performance levels while increased safety or efficient learning in case of a potential exposure for cheating that explicit restrictions often overlook excessively. Firstly, in emergencies, cell phones allow students to communicate efficiently with their parents or guardians when situations arise. Having such technology makes us all feel much safer and gives everyone peace of mind that they can end a bad situation seamlessly when required. This is why parents feel comfortable their children will still reach them in regard even to any security supervisions during education processes on the premises. Besides, learners can use their devices to take notes, not to mention that cell phones present a benefit over pen and paper during notes taking by being able to support multimedia, enabling better-performing generators when devising an assignment.

{"id":41,"text":"I am against this topic I think it will distract the students I say this, because they will be trying to change their emotiones to get diffrent things. I think it violates their privacy and other things Now days it tis not hard to hack into a computor and take pictures of the person on the other side. This FACS thing will probaly encourage the person to hack into a computor and change the pop ups or the emotions based of the other persons emotions It could lead to people making the computor say special things to make a person happy about themselves, but it could lead to them talking the other person to meet them outside school. What is your thoughts? I am strongly against this topic, because if I was a parent I would not want my kid using this product. I say this, because there are a lot of creepy, crazy, and a stalker It could be used to lead the child to do a surtain thing. The pop ups chould lead the child to see or do bad things. The pop up could be changed by a hacker if they want. They could tell them to do drugs or drink under age. This is all bad for a kid. I would never want my kid to do any of that if I was a parent. I would never want my kid if they were old enough to drive and get drawn into drinking by a pop up ad and then kill someone, because they where drinking and driving. Another reason I am against this is for the teachers side of things. Say you where a teacher and had FACS on the computor and all your students where changing their emotions to get diffrent pop ups. There your students are destracted and are not listening to your lecture or lesson for the day. Then you have to stop class and get onto the students. Then you may have a kid tell his mom or dad you yelled and told the class to stop goofing around. With their emotions. Then they call the school and you then have to go to a meeting about what happened. Then you will have to try not to get into trouble by the state or you head leader. This could cause a lot of disruptions in the class and they will not get the education that they are there for. I am not saying that there is not already a lot of destractions alreadyby phones, talking, and chromebooks. It is not going to be as bad as emotion based pop ups. For the muscle and painting part of the passage. I think it had no relavents to the main idea of emotion based pop ups Back then when the Mona Lisa was painted they didn't have computors or advanced technology. It could of been stated a little bit diffrent. Like\" Mona Lisa never rarly smiled, but now as technology advanced and we now know that muscles change our facial emotions.\" It then could help the scientific side of the FACS. Like now we know that your muscles help you change facial emotions. This then could help us then have more emotion based pop ups This may sound like I am for they FACS, but I not for it. It is a vilation of privacy. What if the kid is having very bad thought like death or harm. Which is a very bad thing in teens today. This could lead to those bad pop ups again. All in all I thing this FACS should be outlawed in the U.S. and other countrys. I thing it could be used in a bad way. If I was a parent I would never ever let my kid use this FACS. I thing it coul sway my kids thinging and ideas. Also it would affect why they are at school. I sent them to school for an education, so they can get a could job. If I was a parent I would never want to see my kid on the crime life.","label":"human"}
{"id":42,"text":"Thanks in advance! Travelling: it is something everyone should have the pleasure of experiencing. I have had this pleasure throughout my life and started travelling at a very young age. When I was two months old I took my first plane ride the UK to visit my father's side of my family. Now, being only two months old I can't exactly say I remember it in detail, but I still like to think it made the first impact on my life. After that first trip my family and I would travel back and forth, every other year if we could, to Wales and England. This was only the beginning of my adventures. My father works for Chevron and travels around the world to different job sites. This made growing up difficult. He would leave home for three weeks and then come back for one for about eight years of my life. It was on that eighth year that he finally invited my mother and me along. Our destination: China. Ten years ago and I still remember details like it was yesterday. There were malls that were underground, small animals I'd never even imagined, and buildings twice the size of any I'd ever seen. I will never forget that trip. It was the trip of a lifetime and when I caught my first travelling bug. Seeing everything was just intoxicating and fascinating. To see the way the other side of the world lived was exciting. I couldn't wait to get home and tell everyone how amazing it was, but of course there were the nonbelievers. My teacher of all people was one of them. She sent a letter home accusing me of lying and making up stories about my trip, so my own father took off work one day to come to school and show the teacher all the pictures of me and ended up giving a presentation to the students about China. To this day my family still gets a kick out of the story; I just wish I could remember the teacher's face when she was proven wrong. However, that was only the beginning: five years later when I was twelve my dad gave us the opportunity to move to South Korea. We gladly accepted the move and packed up and left. The two years there just added to my travelling kick. This time I made friends and broadened my world perspective. The international school I went to was a melting pot of cultures and I got to experience them all. This is the trip I'm most thankful for because it really widened my perspective. I'm very lucky to have had these experiences and unlike many of the other people I meet on these travels I actually appreciate what I've learned. I've seen the Eiffel Tower, Big Ben, The Great Wall of China, and the Korean DMZ all before I was eighteen. Now I've embarked on my newest adventure: Australia. I will spend my senior year here seeing the sights and experiencing the culture. It was not an easy decision to leave my friends on the last year of school with them, but it is definitely worth it. I can't wait to see where else life will take me.","label":"human"}

{"id":44,"text":"The money my mom earns are pennies compared to Bill Gates' fortune; however, my will to pursue college never falters. My family, especially my grandfather, motivates the will in me to carry on. I would enter college and fulfill my dreams for him and me. In this heart of mine, I know that won't be a rocket scientist or a terrorist who kills millions of people, but I can change the world. For me changing the world is saving one life at a time. A few years back, my grandmother broke the news to us that Grandpa has cancer. They decided to keep the news from him; believing that in his situation, ignorance is bliss. By then, I understood enough of what was happening. Grandpa and I have a solid relationship, and the Grandpa I know is strong and imposing. Seeing him in a new light - the vulnerable side - made me want to pursue medicine. From a distance, I wanted to wind back time: to stop the origins of cancer, and all degenerative diseases; however, reality can't lie. I can't keep looking back; the only step to take is forward. If I become well-educated in the world of health and sciences, my efforts in saving lives would not be in vain. I hope not only to stretch out a hand to my immediate relatives, but also to the rest of the world. I am not Wonder Woman who could save the world in a jiffy. But if I become successful after receiving quality education from colleges and universities, I hope to open up a clinic for people of low or no income. I, myself, have experienced how to live a life without medical assurance. There are more people who aren't as lucky and blessed as I am, and they deserve these medical outreach that can only be funded by non-government organizations and willing individuals. By helping these people, I somehow changed the world; or for starters, my community. My future education has a direct effect on my family, for they are on the top of my list. If I, with God's will, do well in the profession I wish to pursue, I would elevate my family from the heap of poverty. This is one of my life-long goals: to help my family. I have been a role-model to my younger siblings, and being on the path of college is like seeing a beacon of light in the darkness. Many of us are fearful in even just stepping on the road to college, hearing the difficulties that one has to go through and the challenges that one should surpass. I would break the bondage to blue-collared employers, if I managed to get higher education. I would be able to earn wages that are higher than the minimum, and hopefully, will be able to support my siblings' education in college, too. My ultimate goal for my education is to reach college, and finish medicine. Many people have attested my decision and will to pursue such a career, for I look very weak and vulnerable. My outer appearance is a great facade, for the core of my being is strong-willed and persistent. I hope that I would end up being a stronger and wholesome individual who wouldn't fear the trials in life. Many insults have been thrust upon me and my family; in the end, I wanted to prove these people wrong. I don't want to be one of those doctors who work only for all the money they could get. I have experienced both lives: the rich and the poor. And living poorly with a happy family is better than living rich and alone. I don't want to be part of another statistic showing how doctors are greedy for more money. I want to be exceptional: the doctor who helps the sick without asking anything in return. Furthermore, I admit that I wouldn't be as kind as the Good Samaritan, but my goal would always be saving one life at a time, for it can change the world. 10. Describe what, if any, exposure you have to college through friends, relatives, or siblings who attend (or have attended) college. Have you visited their campus? Have they discussed the college application process with you or shared aspects of college life with you? At this very moment, I am standing at the end of the bridge connecting high school and college. I am at the brink of completing my secondary education for the second time around. I was a graduating student once in my former school; however, the need to migrate here retained me in high school. Back in the Philippines, we didn't undergo middle school education; we just go straight to high school: a reason why I have to go back two spaces on my game board. I've done all the tedious college applications before and took my college entrance examinations in two of the most prestigious universities in the Philippines. I've visited their campuses for summer camps, too. Furthermore, I am very familiar to their curriculums and tuition fees, for I've attended many college orientation events sponsored by these top-notch colleges. However, I have only a little background information regarding the universities in here. I research the top medical schools to find which my mom can afford to send me. I only went to colleges near my county like Willow International and Fresno State College. Some colleges went to our school last year and gave us some briefing to their school requirements. Since traveling is too costly, these conventions help students like me a lot. To arrange my flight to college, I rely on two accessible ways to get the facts straight: my counselor's advice regarding college selection and the internet. College is a world of new dimensions. It trains individuals for real life, encourages self-reliance and new innovations, requires one to step out of the norm, and lets one think outside the box. There will be numerous changes that one should adapt to. As of the moment, research is the only guide for me for the crossroads that lie ahead. 11. Which two colleges are you most likely to (realistically) attend? (Schools which you feel qualified for, would be accepted to, and can picture yourself attending.) Provide a detailed action plan (steps you would take) as how you would reach this college goal. (Include information or resources you'll utilize, how you will prepare through study, who you will seek advice from, and how your familyteacherscommunity will support you.) Alex, the lion in the movie Madagascar, had a birthmark on his right paw shaped like the African continent. When his parents saw this, they pictured a clear future for their only son. Alex inherited this birthmark from his dad who was the current alpha of the pride. They will dub him the next alpha if he surpasses certain obstacles. Alex, however, had a different idea of success: being the greatest entertainer of Central Park Zoo in New York City. My parents also saw a bright future ahead of me when my first cry resonated in the operating room. They envisioned me as a successful person no matter what path I choose to take in the future. My parents, though, thought of only three paths for the so-called \"any path\": medicine, engineering, or business. Fortunately, the road I'm taking is leading to what they want, too. I chose medicine: it would certainly make my family proud, and I would be able to help other people as well. In the near future, I envision myself entering the doors of UC Berkeley or UC Davis. According to my research, UC Berkeley merges with UC San Francisco for their medical curriculum. Learning this, I didn't hesitate to make more inquiries. I hold a great trust to the faculty of UC San Francisco - they were the ones who conducted a neurosurgery for my grandmother's tumor. I am currently working on all the requirements to get in. Furthermore, I'm planning to take my SATs by March to get a head start for my college prerequisites. Furthermore, I've borrowed a few SAT preparatory books from the public library and some AP exam books, too. Taking four AP classes may help me gain college credits. Mom paid only five bucks for each exam compared to the mandatory eighty-six for other well-off students. Hopefully, I pass the exams. My current GPA is acceptable for any UC, but, getting into college isn't pure grades. Community involvement, volunteer, and co-curricular activities are also key steps to get accepted by these high-ranking colleges. I wanted to go to Ivy League schools, too; I am currently getting more information about it. Even if deep inside me, I know that there are better and smarter students than me who would get in, I wouldn't think twice in submitting my application. I'll never know what it's like unless I try. As of UC Davis, my preparations are the same. Since their necessities are very similar to UC Berkeley, I am hitting two birds with the same stone. My problem as of the moment is getting scholarships. Since every UC is public-funded, there would be a slim chance of getting a full scholarship. If I get scholarships from private institutions, my mom would allow me to go study there, even if it's out of the state. When Alex's parents knew about his real career, they were appalled; however, our parents are always there to back us up. Whatever my decisions are, my mom is always there for me. She's always my biggest fan. Initially my mom had a game plan for me. She's planning to send me back to the Philippines to study med-school. It's cheaper there, and I don't need to pay for a dormitory. I could live with my grandparents and take care of them at the same time. In order to fulfill my duties as a citizen, I would just go back here every year during the summer vacation. However, I weighed the pros and cons of that decision. If I leave and graduate there, I would have a hard time getting a job because I have a foreign diploma. I persuaded my mom to give me the chance to study here; \"I could get grants from sponsors,\" I attempted. To fulfill my promise to Mom, I have started applying for scholarships through the internet. My teachers are essential to my success as a student, too. Their willingness to help me out every time I have an inquiry builds a strong connection between us. I have teachers whom I barely knew who were willing to give me letters of recommendations. I am considered fortunate to be living in such a healthy and helpful environment. The approval of my family, teachers, and friends has made me continue to reach the stars. Even if they are far beyond reach, I would continue to shoot for them, for nothing can hold me back except my fear in God, and them. 12. What will you do this summer if you don't attend the SAYS Summer Residential Program? When the humid air blows across my face, happiness would swell up inside me: summer is here. Summers indicate that I would engage myself with the many hours of community involvement opening up to new experiences and insights. I typically help my grandfather's business by keeping watch of the store grounds. When I was young, a seed of ambition was planted into my mind - to become \"that lady with the white coat and a stethoscope on her neck\". Serving the community in my own little ways had always been a part of me. I plan on spending my time volunteering at the St. Agnes Medical Center and Woodward Park Regional Library. Just a summer ago, I volunteered at the library twice a week to promote reading as a hobby. There were prizes for these children who commit themselves; the prize could just be a pencil or an eraser, but the important thing is that these prizes motivated them to engage into a new field of learning. Also, I have a chance to shadow a phlebotomist who has offered to teach me bits and pieces of the procedures they do, the equipments they use, and the tests they perform. If given the chance, I might also visit the emergency room and learn some first aid lessons with the paramedics. I am also planning to tutor incoming freshmen algebra and geometry over the summer not only to interact with children my age, but also to learn more about their cultures and traditions.","label":"human"}

As a virtual assistant, I believe technology can help provide an enhanced learning experience by increasing the way information is consumed and delivered. One of the primary benefits of having a system of communication for school work is the ease with which information can be disseminated. With advanced audiovisual systems commonly available today, students can attend different classes remotely, without having to physically be present in the class. This greatly aids the student learning process.

Robots operating as wheels with screens can interact with classmates and pick papers, just like the student was ever present physically clear on sheets without being physically similar around them. However, I believe that the effectiveness of teaching will primarily depend on how educators use technology to facilitate a creative outcome for learners. With the increasing prevalence of digital education styles comes the standard of studying from home, illustrating the feel of distance education. Its potent system requires better management inputs in college departments by monitoring full-participation frequency in classes in user action coupled with technological interactions. The benefit of having a modern efficient information delivery plan is immense and advantageous to both stakeholders determining intended productivity output. Overall, technology creates a definitive educative pair to strategize and socially separate scholars while free classified demonstrations, erasing boundaries to commence physical activity operations by lawmakers enforcing pedagogical stipulations wherein imminent foreign virtual trade exigencies require careful trading interventions aligned with actionable students. In conclusion, the social mania follow up may resemble cultural shift educational change delivery for transformation resembling coursework participants strengthened by devices like iPads having standard educational software sharing templates for offline shared materials","label":"ai"}
{"id":47,"text":"The Electoral College system has been a matter of debate for decades, with proponents hailing its stability and the opposition arguing against its validity. As a citizen who cares deeply about the democratic process, I am personally against the Electoral College system for electing the President. I urge my state senator to consider phasing out this antiquated privilege system and opting for a direct vote. My first major reason for scoffing at the Electoral College is that it is undemocratic and gives more power to the government than it should have. Small states tend to deviate from larger states on issues related to leadership. Representation is skewered with more influence given to a state having a less least square reputation. Winning precise note swing states is enough to target campaigning towards and these primary areas can decide electionists overthrow national popular representation. For national leadership, balance should reign over spotlighted supremacy important ideologies. Hearing diverse voices will in course more effectively produce communications. My second rationale demonstrating my disdain for the Electoral College is that is provisions for an irrelevant President-elect. candidates with deep enough faction appeal may gain working behind scenes count of popular triumph points. From history's catalogue, candidates are many multiple times confident for Presidency using exorbitant reasons leading to policy-making cover promises and undisclosed skeletons running for apt characteristics.

{"id":49,"text":"Education is a critical part of one's growth and development. However, various factors could limit an individual from accessing the education they desire. Factors such as anxiety, social disabilities, distance, and sickness can derail the pursuit of education for individuals irrespective of their curriculum level. Fortunately, the advent of technology has brought about an innovative concept in learning - online or video conferencing distance learning. In this essay, we will explore the benefits of online or video conferencing distance learning with a focus on how it can provide a safe and comfortable environment for those with had anxiety and social disabilities, allow learning from far schools, and permit students to continue their education even when sick. To begin, online or video conferencing distance learning provides a comfortable and safe learning environment for those suffering from anxiety or social disabilities. Traditional classroom set-ups can pose considerable psychological challenges such as anxiety- and panic attacks for people suffering from social anxiety attacks. Contrarily, through technology-based learning, such students can participate and interact with the curriculum remotely from environments that cause them less mental distress. The virtual settings in online classes are safe spaces that create a sense of comfort and minimizes psychological and social disquietude that outsiders could generate, providing a better mental state to process and constructively engage with the academic materials. Online or video conferencing distance learning can also aid in the national or international dispersal of academics, mainly for academic programs requiring specialized training that could only be accessible at a few institutions around the world. A student living in France, for example, may require an overseas education for an academic program they are passionate or interested about, dwell in the US, UK, or any other country beyond France geographically. Fortunately, students no longer have to occupy the school surroundings physically for education submergence. Through technology, students situated at particular geographical points access lectures remotely and interact with lecturers in real-time as students who are on-premise. This flexibility opens several educational doors, providing a diversity of landscapes to gain optimal academic pursuits from prestances offshore. Further still, online or video conferencing distance learning facilitates learning despite when a student is physically couch-bound through sicknesses like flus and other ailments. Before online learning deeps install as a reality amidst the world, students recover relax thorough brush-clearing only paths laid undoubtedly downwards cessation if alerted passed default come alive quit hard years beyond would think here delay continue material education imparts just quiet.

So either way students are going to end up using there cell phones anyway don't matter what the problem is. Some students might leave there gym clothes or homework they had that night.

{"id":52,"text":"Implementing a policy that requires students to maintain a B-average or higher in order to participate in sports activities can have both benefits and drawbacks. On one hand, this policy has the potential to improve overall academic performance and incentivize students to prioritize their studies. However, it can also have negative consequences, including lowered motivation amongst students and potential backlash from the community. The potential benefits of implementing this policy include a higher emphasis on education and improved academic outcomes. When students are chasing a B-average in order to participate in sporting events, it forces them to prioritize their studies over extracurricular activities,\nresulting in better performance in the classroom. Moreover, this policy has the potential to create a culture of achievement throughout the student body- where students take pride in excelling academically and in their respective sports. On the other hand, implementing this policy may have negative consequences such as increased anxiety, stress and demotivation for students who are already struggling academically. The policy may distract students from their primary responsibility-education-to the detriment of the quality of academic performance. Also, it might serve as potential access restriction when extracurricular activities limit enrolment needed for successful sporting events participation. The impacts of implementing the policy accompanied by a school's responses towards students need extensive studies, review and sensitisation before enactment. Lastly, teachers may easily become irritate in continually staying feasible with constant students' academic performance despite rigorous study schedules which can hamper Quality Time. Ultimately, whether or not the benefits of implementing this policy outweigh the drawbacks depend on the specific context of each school. Before making any decisions, schools should carefully evaluate potential implications in academic stand-goal, in healthier teenage living spaces, academic participation consider available data, prioritize students' rights with concerns from stakeholders. With this thorough and customer-centered approach there will be more coherence towards desired school growths.","label":"ai"}

{"id":54,"text":"The mysterious \"face\" on Mars has sparked controversy for decades as some people argue that it could be a sign of extraterrestrial or ancient civilization on the red planet, while others dismiss it as a natural rock formation. However, a closer examination of the evidence reveals that it is almost certainly not a sign of life or aliens. Firstly, images taken by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter have revealed that the \"face\" on Mars is actually a huge mesa, or flat-topped mountain, that rises about 1,500 feet above the Martian surface. This mesa, known as the \"Cydonia Mensae,\" is about three miles long and a mile wide, and its topography creates the illusion of a humanoid face. The search for life on Mars by NASA has produced little until now to suggest that any microbial activity has taken place. Hence, if Mars was ever inhabited by aliens, we have been about the best equipped to detect them. Furthermore, high-resolution photos taken by NASA's Mars Curiosity Rover don't show anything out of the ordinary in the vicinity of Cydonia Mensae. In fact, the rover hasn't detected traces of anything even resembling gas-pumping or heat-processing aliens. Moreover, the \"face\" on Mars appeared supernatural because of the way our human brains process information, a psychological phenomenon called pareidolia. Pareidolia refers to the tendency of the human mind to perceive meaningful patterns or objects in meaningless stimuli or random-data, such as hearing music in the drone of white noise, recognizing a rabbit-like constellation in the stars, or interpreting shapes on a dirty floor as signs. Therefore, it could be very much the production of such human fallibility rather than anything supernatural. Plus, scientists advise that space research needs significant cash rather than fixing optical illusions so emphasis or working on falls that necessarily needs attention aren't surveyed with enough detail. It's understandable to harbor speculations regarding discoveries like that of \"the face\" on Mars. Still, conclusive investigations done over the years have permitted space scientists insights into Mars environment, geology and probably minimizing speculating. That is human resourceful ability that does naturally lack creativity boundary. In case of specificity -- it could have completely sank into tenacity, If Cydonia could detect or enhance confirmation by studying the inhabitancy of possible relevant microbes on its envirorns or any other ideal wavelengths aside high-resolution photographs of the Martian surface detailing absolutely nothing alien-like.

The sermon began when a plump middle-aged man waddled on to the stage and without delay, delved into a delicate topic.\" Sex between a man and a man or a woman and a woman is disgusting.\" I fidgeted in my plastic chair but, said nothing. I allowed the lies and the ignorance to seep over me and my companions. Furthermore, I did not even struggle when the intolerance enveloped me.

The purpose of this essay is to argue that attending classes at school is better than taking classes online, for several reasons. First, attending classes at school teaches students to limit distractions and focus on what is at hand, opposed to taking online classes that don't keep them on slotted and lectured atmosphere. The biggest for online a personal laptop on a bed becomes blended with an impersonal atmosphere that doesn't stoked the serious and reminded student lecture.

{"id":63,"text":"*Did I try to squeeze in too much information? It took me seventeen years to realize what an extraordinary influence my mother has been on my life. She's the kind of person who has considerate discussions about what she can do following retirement to shrink her carbon footprint, the kind of mother who always has time for her four children, and the kind of role model that showed me I don't have to be a part of organizations to still be committed to helping the environment or the people in my community. I not only came to adore the excitement of learning simply for the sake of knowing something new, but I also came to understand the initiative of giving back to the community in trade for a new sense of life, love, and independence. My mother works very hard at her job, but she also doesn't hesitate to relax when given the chance, she stops to appreciate life, and enjoys stretching her creative wings, whether it is in her gardens or countless diaries. It is difficult to balance between the responsibilities that come with work and finding time to take pleasure in the West Texas breeze. But, watching her do so with compassion has taught me to appreciate life beyond the countless hours I put into my studies. My mother's enthusiasm for learning is most evident in her love of knowledge. As a teacher my mother has always understood how important education is, and how far school can get you. My mother likes to study and to read everything, from books to newspapers, fact or fiction. Because of that, she has become a well-informed person, who seems to have some knowledge about almost everything. When I think about my childhood I can still recall the countless nights I laid with my mother in bed while she read me to sleep. I'll always appreciate the numerous hours enjoying the mother daughter book club, and the talks we shared about politics, school, or even religion. While I value the various knowledge my mother has shared with me, I was equally transformed by what she has shown me just a few miles from my house. I used to accompany my mother to the annual trips to recycling center in Bastrop. That first summer after we moved to Alpine recycling was considerably different. I decided to volunteer at the local recycling center myself, which was only a trailer with only several bins for the few contributors. There were only three volunteers, one being myself, and I was the only high school student. Martha was one of the volunteers I worked with; together we assembled bins and placed adhesive stickers on them. The adhesive stickers had information on what can be recycled, when, and where. Together we expanded the recycling community by offering out the bins to anyone interested. I placed the several bins at the city pool I worked at next to the Coca-Cola vending machines, and to several of my friends. Although the position is often tricky, the personal rewards are beyond articulation. In the time I have lived in Alpine the Recycling center has expanded increasingly, it has moved from a trailer to a permanent site. The hours have expanded from only Saturday to every day of the week, and the partakers are continual. My mother guided me in the correct direction and with a little push, I opened my wings and showed myself what I am capable of. When I attended Bastrop Middle School my grade point average was a high B. When my mother decided to make the move to Alpine, she inspired me to take advantage of the opportunity. She knew I wasn't happy with where I was academically before, and she let me know that she would be there to assist me in reaching my goal of becoming a better student. She helped me become organized with my studies; she stood behind me through elections, sports, clubs, and any other extracurricular activity I wanted to pursue. Furthermore, she taught me that I am exactly what I think I am, no more, no less. I want to take advantage of all the opportunities' life sends in my direction. I'll never forget the semester of my junior year. All the stresses from school academically were pushing me to the extremes, my mom was there to help me manage things, and to remind me where I was a few years ago, and how far I've come. Beyond school, my mom is very supportive of whatever interests I have. She instilled within me a competitive drive to continue to challenge myself not only in school but in life. Even through all the AP classes, dual enrollment courses, and sports throughout high school, the most valuable lessons I learned were from my mother. My mother is a person who has given me so many things, who has taught me about everything, who has shown me how beautiful life is, and gradually as I get older, and I become more mature, she has opened my eyes to the fact that life is not always beautiful and happy like in a fairy tale, but life is much more than that. Next year, I will find a new home miles away. However, my mother will always be by my side.","label":"human"}

Describe examples of your leadership experience in which you significantly influenced others, helped resolve disputes, or contributed to group efforts over time. Consider responsibilities to initiatives taken in or out of school. (Minimum 750 Characters) One of my most exhilarating leadership experiences has been the president of the Art Troupe, which is the first association organized by students spontaneously to contract performances like the school's anniversary party. Before I become the president, I am just a girl who love to express herself by sing and dancing. Until one day I was told by my teacher that she wants me to lead the junior students organizing a Christmas Party. I knew she proposed me for the leader out of her trust, but I do feel stressful at the same time. We practiced every night for two weeks, rehearsed over and over again. What surprised me most was they were never late. One of the students told me once because of her illness, she missed some days practices, however instead of finding other student to replace her, I helped her catch up. The Christmas Party was stunning and since I earned the respect from them, I was chosen president of the Art Troupe. Describe any special interests and how you developed knowledge in these areas. Give examples of your creativity - the ability to see alternatives; take diverse perspectives; come up with many, varied or original ideas; or willingness to try new things.

A perfect hotel has a fine location, nice food, and most importantly good service that makes the traveling people feel like home. So, to experience the services from different hotels become my special interests. I have stayed in several hotels and I would earnestly fill out the Customer Feedback Form next day. However, I got tired of being the customer, one day I created my first resume and handed to a popular hotel in my hometown. I did not tell my family until I got this internship since I love doing thing on my own. Certainly I had a wonderful time there and all these experiences help me grow.

Tell us how you responded and what you learned from these experiences and how they have prepared you to contribute to the UNL community. (Minimum 750 Characters) I have a very close friend, Sam. Sam is a gay, but he did not until he went to high school. When he spanked up enough courage to tell me what kind of person he really is, I got shocked and ran away. Trying to avoid people you care was pretty hard. Every time I saw the eyes of Sam, I saw helpless and struggling. So I accepted the new Sam, and after we had a long heart-to-heart conversation, they decided to keep the secret. But life is no TV show. It was found out when a boy overhearded our conversation and this breaking news ran rapidly in the school. Boys started to slight him: they refused to have lunch with Sam on the same table, called for his expulsion from the sports team, even put the outdated cream in his shampoo just because he was homosexual. I could not bear this anymore, so I told our teacher what was happening on Sam. It turned out the teacher asked Sam's parents to bring him home. I will never forget the words he said to me when he left:\" I am not shame who I am\". I used to think gay person only exist in television, but when this thing really happen to the person you care, it is really not a big deal. Therefore, I will not only show my talent to the community but also treat others with a broadened mind and open arms, be a good listener.","label":"human"}

{"id":68,"text":"Many people, especially teenagers, are dying because of the use of cell phones while driving. The question is, should people be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. I believe people should not be able to use cell phones while driving. People get distracted very quickly when they are on the phone Many accidents are caused because people try to read or respond to text messages while driving. Even when using a hands free device such as a Bluetooth, talking on the phone is still very distracting and causes the driver to pay less attention to other cars. According to the National Safety Council (NSC), \"Everyday 9 people are killed and more than 1000 people were injured in crashes involving distracted drivers\" (National Safety Council, 2019). In the same article, the National Safety Council said that \"drivers looking out the windshield can miss seeing up to 50% of what's around them when talking on a cell phone\" (National Safety Council,2019). The NSC also reminds people in the article that your mind can only process one task at a time, so you cannot talk on the phone and read a book at the same time (National Safety Council, 2019). This is why even if you are using a hands free device to talk on the phone, the conversation is still occupying your mind while you are supposed to be focused on driving. Most states have fines for being caught texting while driving If you are texting while driving and kills someone, you could be charged with vehicular homicide or manslaughter. If found guilty of these charges, you could spend a lot of time in jail. I think this is a really good law because even though it doesn't stop everyone from texting while driving, it does stop some people who know this is a law and they could go to jail for breaking it. In conclusion people shouldn't be able to use cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Many people have lost loved ones and their own lives because of driving while being on their cellphones. Driving while texting and killing someone will put you in prison for a very long time. Distracted driving, like just talking on the phone, causes many accidents. No conversation is that important. Just wait until you are not driving","label":"human"}
{"id":69,"text":"I would like to ask of you to please lower your requirements from having a grade B average to a C average. This way more students will be able to participate in after school activities or any sports. Many students have a C average, and if one must have a B average then there won't be many students involved more at school anymore because of their grades. Since students wouldn't be able to participate after school they might be out doing bad things they should not be doing. For example, if there is a grade C average student, and he or she isn't able to participate in an after school activity he or she might be out doing something far more worst. Is that something you would want your students to be doing? If you were to lower the requirements to a grade C average, then we would have more students involved with their school. Also, a C is a passing grade so you wouldn't have to worry about them failing. In addition, maybe having them in after school activities or any sports could help them bring up their grade by motivating them to get a higher grade and to not slack in any of their studies because they must maintain a C average or above. I know you may think having the requirements of have a C will maybe let them think they must not try harder in their work or studies but please have in mind that your students will know that you gave them a chance to try and be involved more in school, have fun, and get to be a part of their school's sports team or volunteering club or whatever it is they'd like to be in. All we must do is just tell them to try and bring up their grades, motivate them so they can become great people in the future.","label":"human"}

So we talked about doing it and i tried it i kind of liked it it was fun because of the basketball drills and got to meet new friends on the team. after that i started doing flag football, and tackle football and i enjoyed it and i was always busy and occupied. i think students who don't do any sports should try it. because it will keep you busy and you would enjoy it because you meet new friends and its very competitive. other than that it will keep you from being on your phone and staying home all day bored when you can be out having fun playing sports. And also sports would make you think about what you wanna do in the future if you really like sports and good at it.

I never thought that this moment would actually come. Just yesterday I was playing with my friends happily, perhaps, to avoid the fact that I am leaving my home and my mother. My sister and I had been petitioned by our father to come to America accompanied by our grandfather. This moment would have come sooner had my mom took care of the papers. When she received my father's letter about the petition papers, she ignored it. What mother can bear to lose their children? She spoke to us about it, and we all decided not to discuss the matter. Finally, after two years, she took us to Manila and began to process the petition papers. Did my mother give up on us? Did she want us to go away? These questions lingered in my thoughts but knowing my own mother, she would not dare. Like many, she would give up her life for us. During our two months stay in Manila, I confronted her about it. She looked at me and tried to explain, but her tears uncontrollably trickled down her cheeks. The only thing she could whisper was, \"I am doing this for you\" and gave me a hug I will never forget. I did not understand what she said. Six months later we are off to America. My grandfather even ended his Philippine vacation just so my sister and I would not be alone in the plane. Both of us were so exhausted from crying that we fell asleep as soon as the plane gained altitude. My mom and I had been protecting my sister from any family problems ever since. We did not want her to feel any sadness. All I could say to her now was about going to Disneyland. It made her happy. The next thing I knew, we are driving down a freeway. Looking out the window, I gazed upon the bald mountains and the calmness of the traffic. I must be dreaming. I wanted to wake up and see my mother again! Instead, I turned around and saw my stepmother playing with my little brother. Sleeping next to me is my sister. I fell back to sleep, again. All these years I had been troubled, depressed and tried to adapt to this foreign country and my new family. A part of me never accepted any of it. Yet the look on my mother's eyes vividly remained in my memory. It kept me going hoping to see and be with her again. My mother did what she had to do without thinking of herself.

The decision-making is pushed down to the business unit rather than being driven by the top management. Salesforce's Tableau and Slack acquisitions are adaptive, quick, innovative, and much required in a changing and complex environment. With Slack and Tableau, Salesforce has an edge against other cloud providers in the platform space.","label":"human"}
{"id":84,"text":"I do not think students will benefit from attending class from home because even though it may seem easier and more fun students will be missing various skill that can be only be gained in school, and they will face other obstacles along the way like:procrastination lack of peer resources, and loss of hands on experience. Students who attend classes from home will be in the comfort of their home which is the exact reason it wont benefit them. Being in the comfort of your home will tempt students to loose track and not stay focused while in a school environment there are teachers who make that task almost impossible. Also,students who take school from home will procrastinate much more because of the fact that there arent technically any peers to help them get back on track. Which me brings me to my next point,peers. They are a fundamental part of life, they help us and change us to be a better person,but for students who take school from home they lack the support of peers and teachers. Which ultimately leaves them out of the experience of a real life scenario because in real life you will be surrounded by people and wont be in the comfort of your home. School has the ability to teach you those skills you need when you grow up, and in school they not only teach you the skills but make you apply them in the school environment which leads you to be better prepared in the future. That brings me to my final point which is students being prepared for the future. Students who take in school classes learn necessary skills that they will use throughout their life;for example,public speaking,social conduct,and time management. These are important skills that students can only learn in school and students take online school will be missing out on these benefits because with online school your only interaction is with a computer screen which gives you no no life skills whatsoever. Students who take online school gain no benefit from it because it offers no vial skill; the only skill they can gain is following textbook concept tutorials that have no emotion behind them(another lack of peer resource). Ultimately,online class may seem like a better alternative but the cons clearly outweigh the pros leaving you with nothing but a screen to look at and a future that you arent ready for.","label":"human"}

It provides winner take all method it avoids run-off elections and there is a certainty of outcome I feel that the electoral college is not anachorism because it belongs in the present to. First of all the electoral college should stay because it provides a winner take all method. The winner take all method is getting a swing state. A swing state is good to win because people in toss up states pay close attention to the election. They actually listen to the canidtes and what they are speking about. They are known to be the most thoughtful voters on average. Secondly the electoral college should stay because it avoids run off elections. The electoral college makes sure that no canidate recieves a maajority of the votes cast If no one wins a majority of the votes cast then it would add pressure to the election because it would greatly complicate the presidential election which is reduced by the electoral college If it wasnt for the electoral college then half of the people like democrats of texas and republicans in california wouldnt vote because their votes dont count. Third of all the electoral college should stay because it provides a certainty of outcome. A dispute over an outcome is possible but not certain that you would win. But on the other hand a dispute over the popular vote is more likely to win. The reason for that is that a winning canidates share of electoral votes exceeds his share of popular votes. A tie is possible due to the total number of votes being 538 but it is very unlikely. In conclusion I think that the electoral college should stay because it provides a winner take all method, it avoids run off elections, and it provides a certainty of outcome. I hope that the electoral college stays in the election process forever.","label":"human"}

I am first generation Asian American to live in the United States. My parents moved from India, in order to lead a better life, and give more opportunities to my brother and me. Being the older brother isn't very fun, my parents kept telling me that I have to set a good example for my brother, and that I should study hard now, and then I can play all I want when I grow up. So basically I was that kid that had a busy academic schedule, provided by my parents, and this didn't change until my sophomore year of high school. Sophomore year was a watershed moment in my life, because this was the year I joined Student Government. My parents were completely against this decision, telling me that I should be in a more \"academic\" class then Student Government, and that I will waste my time in this class. Eventually I convinced them to let me stay in the class, but I can't say I was treated with the best respect with this design. Student Government changed me in more ways than I could count. It provided me with one of life's greatest treasures, Friends. These friends helped me to get where I am today. Now I can't really give all the credit to my friends.

{"id":90,"text":"There is a definite before and after where Jonathan is concerned. He influenced my life more than I thought anyone ever could in such a short amount of time, and I put him on a pedestal without realizing that he was just a person, that was all, and flawed just like the rest of us. I built him up to be so legendary in my mind that there was no way the real person could ever live up to such unrealistic expectations. He was my hero, or so I thought. Like I said, he didn't break my heart, not in the way you'd think at least. I trusted him almost implicitly, handing over details of my life and my feelings that I'd never told anyone, not even bothering to write them down in my diary. I trusted him with my heart and my mind, and he treated both as though they were disposable playthings, interesting for a few moments before the novelty wore off. In talking with him, meeting covertly in apple orchards and dead ends, I thought I began to realize how precious life was, and that even though you had to be cautious, you also had to let yourself be free to wander and explore, and to step outside the box that small-town societies often surround young people with. While those were good things to realize, Jonathan pushed me to dig deeper, to go further into the extreme, and I eventually became someone that I didn't know, and didn't really like. It was only after I'd completely changed myself so that he would accept me that I realized Jonathan wasn't my savior or my guide to a better life, but just a silly boy with big ideas who needed someone to expound them to, and I let myself get caught up in all his talk, and let him take advantage of my blind admiration. He might not have been a rock star or an actor, but he gained that type of notoriety in my own mind, and had just as much influence. In letting him go, I felt more than a slight twist in my chest. It was a tangible loss. Jonathan leaving was like that saying - lemons, lemonade. Him leaving was like biting into a lemon. Sour and fresh puckered cheeks, if there's one thing in the world that perfectly personifies betrayal and rejection, it's the choking, hurtful taste of lemons. The recent months of disappointment were like ashes in my mouth At that moment. The pressure of his hand had always given me somewhere to return to, and now that was gone forever. The only thing I could think was that surely there should have been more noise, more drama in a life falling apart. For the longest time afterward I felt like Chicken Lichen screaming that the sky was falling in. Only recently have I realized that in trying to imitate and immortalize Jonathan, I've come into my own. Now I can walk through the hallways with my head held high, knowing that no one will ever make me feel sorry for being myself again. It was only when I finally let the idea of Jonathan go that I realized what a strong person I had become while my head had been turned the other way. After meeting Jonathan, I branched out and befriended students who were different from myself, the more vibrant, the more studious, the more care-free. I found happiness that I'd never realized I'd been missing before. Jonathan gave me the courage and the self-esteem to let me be myself, and not to take any crap for being different or unique. Jonathan gave me the confidence in myself that I'd never had before, that allowed me to go after things that before I would have deemed far out of my reach. Letting him go was like one big sigh, easy and long and just so good, as long as I think about it for too long and too hard. Meeting him was an experience. One that I've hated and loved and treasured and learned from. But he wasn't the one that changed me. I was the one who changed me, who rose up and took on the challenge of becoming the person I am today. It's only afterward, now, that I realize that what I expect from myself, and what actually happens, are never the same thing. If I could define myself in one word, I'd be a pretty boring person, so I won't. But if I did, I think I'd really like that word to be 'strong.' '","label":"human"}

Teachers are used to making the projects rather than the students. Students say that some teachers, but not all, create poor designed projects. They're wondering if they should create a project themselves rather than from a teacher. While some people say teacher design projects are better to use it's more important that students design them instead it helps students become independent workers, increasing their creativity, gain a life experience. It gives students a chance to think outside of the box. I would get more creative due to the fact that there's no boundaries, so I can do anything that I put my mind too. Your student would feel more like this due to them being the only ones making there own project. They'll have to think for themselves, plan by there self, and create something all on their own. It's a great way to gain and be independent. I remeber when my teacher let me do a project on my own it was hard at first, but if I wanted to complete it I had to get it done myself. It's a good practice for students to see how it would be like in college. This will be like a foundation to them when they really have to do this all on their own. I also think from my experience is that not everything is easy it's time consuming, but it's all worth it in the end. It shows that if you put your heart and effort into something it shows no matter what. While some people think letting a teacher designed the projects is better because it's less work for students, less stress on students, and less time consuming, it's better for the students to design them because it'll increase their creativity,\nthey'll gain a life experience, and become more independent.

{"id":94,"text":"Reflect on a time when you challenged a belief or idea. What prompted you to act? Would you make the same decision again?by: Samuel Lungful Choir During my time in Hawthorne middle school, there were many problems about food given in school refectory. The students wished the meals given in the refectory to be higher quality and having better presentation. To make sure all students are having comfortable school life, I ran in school president election campaign and won. As school president, I started working on the different problems students were facing to keep my promise I made during the election. However, the plans I made to improve school food needed large quantity of data about school food and had to make sure that it did not break any regulations given by the district council. Because of amount of time taken to prepare and to get the plan approved, my fellow students started to believe that I will not be able to keep the promises I made during the president election. To prove that I am able to get my plan to success, I concentrated on getting the plan approved. First, I gave all the students a questionnaire and collected the data about student's opinion toward the food given in school refectory. Then the data was sent with the plan to District Council, hoping that the plan will get approved. Soon after, I heard about the news that the plan I sent to District Council was terminated. This proved that I won't be able to improve the quality of food given in refectory. From that point, I realized that the plan will not be influenced by any district council regulations as long as it's inside school event related. So, I used my authority as school president to open a disco party after school using school fund. My council members brought the D. J and I bought the foods for party from stores approved by the teachers. The party was on twice every month and money we collected was given to the charity. Soon after the party, my school friends apologized for their behaviors and disbelief toward me. If I was to be part of same situation once again, I will still try to keep my promise and continue the work even if it fails along the way. I believe that being a president is not about giving up a promise because a plan does not work. One's duty to keep the promise is important as continuing the work persistently and plan intelligently.","label":"human"}

A system by which each state is allocated a range of electors based on their population size, which will ultimately decide the outcome of presidential elections. While the Electoral College holds some mainstay advantages, such as the speed and accuracy in which it runs, differing opinions are swayed towards how the system unequivocally indulges dominant party vote propensity and dilutes organized individual representation. One also has to consider the role of trustworthiness when dealing with the perplexity of popular vote acquisitions. By analyzing and assessing both general advantages and disadvantages, as well evaluate how it delegitimizes representation for voters, this essay aims to dissect the suitability of the Electoral College method for choosing the President of the United States and conclude overall in favor or disfavor.

Technology has come so good in the past 17 years.

I can't even begin to imagine how much more advanced technology is going to get later on in life, it already seems to be that we could possibly have all the technology we could ask for, yet people all around the world just seem to be getting better and thinking of smarter ways to invent new things. Why is this a good idea you may ask. For starters if technology will be able to read kids expressions while learning and being in class for teachers there will be one very good benifit. \" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored\" Dr. Huang predicts this is going to be a very good thing for teachers, because teachers will be able to know what a kid is feeling this means that the teach will no longer have to keep going over the same information with the same kids just because one kid does not understrand it or isnt paying attention. The teacher can focus on those targeted students spicificly, and not have to go over the same information multiply times. Knoledge is a great thing to have. One good benifit from this is that teachers can teach more to kids in a more faster way so they can get more things done, because the FACS will tell you if the kids understands the information and or get bored that way techers can work with those kids in a different time and move on to more things with the kids that do understand it. Having computers that can read kids expresions to tell you whether you are bored or confused is a genius idea. It will be a good thing for both reachers and kids.

The life he had led had roughened them, Asif they had been gritted by sand paper, but he had always been proud of them. He used to say that his hands mirrored his hard work and showcased his victories over his challenges. I could never understand him because as I had looked at my own pair of hands, mine were still fresh and scarred with naivete. My grandfather was born in 1940 to a family of seven. At the age of ten, he had already dropped out of school and by eighteen he had started working as a tailor at a local clothing shop in his village. Reworked tirelessly as a tailor for about seven years, and only received twenty rupees (which is equivalent to less than fifty cents) per day. The old sewing machine could be heard late into the night as my grandfather's aching feet tapped the pedal determinedly. His struggles were not futile, however, as he received a piece of land from his sister for his own. With that, he slowly built up and managed to expand his lands and wealth. Each morning, he patiently drove the oxen through the barren lands in order to cultivate it into farmland for rice and other crops. He was also fond of helping others in his local village. He was the role model to many young people in his small community. As years passed, I slowly started understanding why my grandfather cherished those hands. These were the hands that had single-handedly raised three sons through all those late nights as a tailor. These were the hands that toiled long hours under the sun in order to place food on the table. These were the hands that had managed to create a dynasty from a handful of soil. Although my grandfather passed away a few summers ago, his own life's definition resonates within me. My grandfather has taught me to take pride in all my work, even in my failures. He has also bestowed me with patience and a drive to help others. I carry these values in my everyday life; Volunteer at my local hospital and help organize events in our community. I work hard at school and try to develop my interests outside my classroom as well so that I can pursue my goal of becoming doctor. Furthermore, I have learned that hard work never fails to attain success. Furthermore, I want to look at my own unwavering hands twenty years from now, carrying a scalpel as I strive for my own goals in helping others, and hopefully I can look at my hands fifty years from now and see the same kind of scars, evidence of my efforts and determination to never shy away from my failures and to accept life with grace.","label":"human"}
{"id":101,"text":"When a golfer is setting up to hit a golf short, there are several things they need to take into account. First, they need to understand what club to hit based on the distance to the green, the elevation, wind speed and possibly the contours of the green. For beginning golfers, focusing on the center of the green is probably easiest. More skilled golfers should target areas closer to the pin or that leave them an easier putt or chip. The second step is lining up the shot. It's usually best to approach from the behind the ball to make sure your legs and body are aligned to the target. The target (pin, tree, etc) should take into account a golfers natural tendency to either draw (right to left) or fade (left to right) the ball as well as the direction and strength of the wind. The golfers stance will also affect the trajectory of a ball. If the golfers feet are above the ball or the ball is on a downhill lie, the ball will tend to go to the right. If the golfers feet are below the ball or the ball is on an uphill lie, the ball will tend to go to the left. For left handed golfers, simple reverse the descriptions.","label":"human"}
{"id":102,"text":"The wildfires that rage through California every year are some of the most destructive and dangerous natural disasters that the state faces. The firefighters who work tirelessly to control these fires are some of the bravest and most dedicated professionals in the world. Firefighters working on California wildfires are faced with enormous challenges. The fires can spread quickly, fueled by strong winds and dry conditions, and can be difficult to control. Firefighters often work long hours in dangerous conditions, battling flames that can reach hundreds of feet high. Despite the risks, California's firefighters are highly trained and equipped with state-of-the-art technology to help them do their jobs. They use a range of tools, from helicopters and bulldozers to chainsaws and shovels, to contain the fires and prevent them from spreading. Firefighters working on California wildfires come from all over the state and sometimes from other states as well. They work together in teams, coordinating their efforts to make the most effective use of resources and manpower. They work not just to control the fires, but also to help people who have been affected by them, offering shelter and support to those who have lost their homes or businesses. The bravery and dedication of California's firefighters cannot be overstated. They put their lives on the line to protect others, working tirelessly to control fires that threaten entire communities. Their work is essential to the safety and well-being of the state's residents, and they are rightly celebrated as heroes for their efforts.","label":"human"}

Even though his friends recommended that he should, he didn't really want to do it. All of his friends that joined activities made cool, new friends in the clubs they were in, and became more active when they participated in sports. He was upset that he didn't do any of those things in middle school, but decided that he would give it a chance when he went to high school. When he got home, Generic_Name thought about the kinds of clubs he wanted to join, and different sports he wanted to participate in, and was looking forward to it. Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity during school it can help you make new friends help you become more fit\/ stay active depending on the activity can improve your skills on specific things If you join any sports or clubs, you are definitely going to meet new people to make your friends, which is a great thing because it gives you people to talk to and get along with so you won't be by yourself in any activities you would do after school. However, some people don't like joining clubs because they could be antisocial or can be nervous and have trouble meeting new people but it's okay, it takes time to get used to people you dont know, so joining clubs and making new friends can help you be more social and find it easier to get along with others. Joining sports\/ physical clubs can help you stay in shape and stay healthy most sports will most likely have you break a sweat, and a lot of sports include running and jumping, and require some strength. Volleyball, wrestling, football, basketball, hockey, soccer, etc, keep you active and healthy because your exercising by doing sports which is good for your body, but you have to keep in mind not to overwork yourself because it can become tiring and maybe a little dangerous if you work for too long without taking any breaks. Sports can definitely become rough and you can really get hurt if your not careful, so it's important to get enough sleep, eat right, and stay hydrated before playing so you don't risk getting injured. Being in most clubs can help to improve skills on different things such as art, cooking or baking, acting, writing, sewing, and things like that Some things that are provided in different clubs can really come in handy at some point in your future. Learning new things or improving your skills can impress your friends and family, and can sometimes earn you money. For example, if you improve in art or sewing, you would be able to sell it for a bit of money depending on how skilled you are, maybe $20-$30, or if you're good at cooking\/ baking, you could sell it at a bake sale or maybe just give it to your friends or family to enjoy as a treat. Learning new things and improving skills can be fun, but sometimes it can take time and effort to put into learning new things and improving, so you have to be willing to take time into that and do your best because it's worth it in the end. Generic_Name smiled as he got on his bus on the last day of middle school, as he sat down in his seat with the friends he made during the year through after school activities, they remembered and talked about all the cool sports and clubs they did during their time throughout middle school. They remembered the clubs they joined such as facs club and art club, and how their skills on baking and drawing improved, they also talked about the sports like soccer and basketball they all participated in together, and Generic_Name can definitely say that he's gotten healthier since he joined. When he got home, he thought about trying out for the basketball team again during high school and was really looking forward to it.","label":"human"}

Several years ago, my classmates viewed me as a timid newcomer to Canada who lacked the confidence to present himself in front of others and seemed as though he would never integrate into an unfamiliar environment. Then, my peers saw a boy who was determined to conquer his fear and anxiety; one who gradually stepped out of his comfort zone to introduce himself to others and engage in classroom discussions. Today, my friends describe me as a natural comedian who can bring a table into laughter during lunchtime.

Denser population resulted in an increase of the diversity of culture as there was a greater variety of restaurants and people in schooling. In contrast, the suburban area of Warren, New Jersey is a quiet, secluded, and wealthy town. However, growing up in both of these societies has helped me appreciate the values that both of these areas offer and I would not be the person I am today without the experiences learned in each place. Although Brooklyn was a bigger melting pot of culture and more active, the city was a dangerous place. As a young child my house got robbed, and I had to be cautious walking around in public areas as there was a higher crime rate. This taught me to always be cautious and be aware of my surroundings. I was immersed in greater amounts of different cultures in Brooklyn as there were Hispanic, Asian, and European styles evident in the city. These included restaurants and people that educated me in culture and helped me embrace my own. Warren is a safe town that has taught me the values of good academic work. The competition amongst the student body in Warren is greater and helps propelled me to work harder. I also learned the values of team work and rewards of being able to participate in school sports. However, places are inconvenient to get to as I must drive everywhere and prices for goods are higher. Living in the two places I have a better understanding of where I want to be later in life. There are values that I appreciate in both urban and suburban areas. I yearn to migrate to an area where I can hopefully have a taste of both places.","label":"human"}

{"id":108,"text":"The electoral college is a complicated system put in place in America that determines the winner of presidential elections. Despite numerous criticisms against it, I firmly believe that the electoral college should be kept in place for its historical significance and its part in traditional American culture. One particular advantage of the electoral college is that it provides an avenue for the democratic process while simultaneously preventing the ill effects of direct-popular vote elections. Direct-popular voting would result in the tyranny of the majority since smaller populations may not have their needs administered if they decide the vote. By contrast, in electical college votes allow small states and rural towns to still participate since they get to an equal vote. Moreover, another mythological reason for supporting the electoral college, and I believe it should stay, brings unprecedented balance to the election result, tremendously decreasing the likelihood of ties. It ensures and results in every president taking the office with over 270 electors from around the entire country contributing counts whose weighted distribution has agreed on handing over one presidency over to the arguably demographically unpopular minority party. Eliminating this poly-methodology from the voting process would effectively increase population's coalesced purchasing power... but way artificially weight large metropolitan areas.

Among the most compelling reasons to become a seagoing cowboy are the opportunities to visit various global destinations while also contributing to post-war relief efforts and potentially avoiding military service. Without attractive option pays higher aesthetic dividends than traveling extensively. By becoming a seagoing cowboy, individuals can fulfill their wanderlust and broaden their horizons by traveling to different parts of the world where they can experience different cultures and interact with diverse populations. Travelers can explore new destinations and enjoy exceptional experiences, making unforgettable memories that they will cherish forever. Additionally, this honorable profession provides an opportunity to contribute to post-war relief. Seagoing cowboys provide moral support and materials to the victims of war. When people make a sail, they work a bale of hay, and they touch the industrial might, besides doing something significant for such a great period. Participation has never symbolized evident altruism throughout the global travel history currently. Furthermore, Being a seagoing cowboy may potentially help individuals avoid mandatory military enlistment. This potentially provides peace of mind for those worried about enlistment highly for reasons related to cultural differences, education, religion, or political beliefs. Seagoing cowboys contribute their skills towards war support activities rather than direct U.S troops' handling; this means avoiding combat areas potentially.

{"id":110,"text":"Venus is known as the second planet from our sun, it's sometimes called the \"Evening Star\" despite it wasn't a star at all. It was also referred as Earth's \"twin,\" since Venus is the closest with density and size in terms of Earth's. But, we really don't know alot about Venus. Now why is that we don't sent any rovers, satelites, ANYTHING to get some few informations about Venus for the last three decades? Because anything that touched the surface of Venus surrvived less than three hours. Which gathered the reputation as the as the challenging planet to study. What is the challenges of studying Venus? Well, first of all, The atmospere of Venus has a THICK layer of carbon dioxide the covers 98% of the planet, in which makes Everything a much hoter place,but, to top it of with the atmosphere problem, the clouds in there have highly corrosive sulfuric acid. If we some how passes through the atmosphere, than we'll face ANOTHER problem with the ground. Since Venus is the second planet from our sun and with all those carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the surface ground temperature is over 800 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. In which with the surface and the atmosphere, it could basically melt many types of metal with no problem. Another Problem is that the atmosphereic preassure is 90x greater than our Earth, with that much preassure could easily crushed a submarine that is built to surrvive the deeper end of the ocean. From what we gather small information from our space craft, the geology of venus pretty much have erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes. Despite all of the troubles and challenges that Venus caused, many of the scientists, astronomers, and including the author themself think that it's worth all of the trouble to get s much information as possible to get to know more of Venus But WHY is it worth studying it? Well, Astronomers are fascinated and interested in the past of Venus as many of them has theorized that might've used to be a lot like Earth from long time ago, with Venus used to oceans that support life like ours. Another reasons why it's worth the trouble and money to study it is that Venus could be our next Planetery visit as our nearest option. To me, I'd thought that it wouldn't be worth all the trouble to study more of this when we can study other planets like mars that support life better than Venus since it's surface and atmosphere wasn't as crazy as Venus'.","label":"human"}

This individual is faithful to a proud heritage, a tradition of honor, and a legacy of valor. He understands what is expected of him and that he must never falter. I am this man; I serve my country as a member of the United States Air Force. I have been molded into a person who is extremely motivated, dedicated, and has a strong work ethic; this is my greatest achievement. Growing up as the oldest child, and the only male of three, the military was always a part of my life. A subject that intrigued me, with deep history and brotherhood bonds unmatched by other organizations. Like my grandfather, and father that served before me, I have always had unconditional love for this country. Unfortunately I had a flawed perception that joining the military would only hurt furthering my education. This ignorance caused me to look over the very organization that I would dedicate myself to. I progressed through school as an average student, with the ability to do well but lacking proper work ethic, and the desire to succeed. I continued through my later years in school knowing that I needed to improve but never entirely fixing the problem. The years flew by, and I was left with a flawed perception that I could continue on the path I was on and still end up being a productive individual. I was left with mediocre grades, and little to nothing that set me apart from the crowd. Senior year rolled around, and like many of my classmates I began to prepare for college. As I did research, I noticed the number of students who started college straight out of high school high had a higher failure rate then those who didn't. The numbers stunned me, students that first attended community colleges or were members of the military had a much higher chance of graduating. Essentially students were being sent to school unprepared, they were challenged and weren't able to finish the task. At that moment I realized I wouldn't be able to justify spending money on furthering my education with the uncertainty of being able my degree. \"There are no secrets to success. \"It is the result of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure.\" spoken by General Colin Powell. These words are what I lived by during the last few years, improving myself in every way possible. I had to put myself in the position to succeed, the military was that position. From the moment I raised my hand in defense of this nation, to the moment I graduated from one of the longest, and most demanding technical training schools the military has to offer I remained motivated, dedicated, and became an American Airman.

{"id":114,"text":"I like knowing how things work. As a little girl, I would sit next to my mother as soon as I saw her revising her students' work on plant anatomy. Her old textbooks on plant physiology fascinated me; the detailed pictures of the intricate inside a plant's stem transfixed me. My mother answered my questions as good as she could, often shrinking the facts so that my eight-year-old mind could comprehend them. On one page, the plant and its name, on the next, the individual leaf, then, a group of cells, the organelles and their functions; the more pages I turned, the more engrossed I became. As a child, scientific names were forgotten as soon as they were read. The images, however, were carved into my mind and a flame sparked. My International Baccalaureate Biology classes fed that fire; now, a senior in high school, all I can see myself doing is learning more about living tissue and cell behavior, not just how, but why. A whole new world, invisible to the unaided human eye, was suddenly presented to me: the molecular world. I felt the wheels turning as my teacher explained the life processes cells undergo in order to survive; Biology and I were in the same wavelength. Although I have learned more about cells, this knowledge only brought up more questions in my mind. I know what photosynthesis is and how enzymes are inhibited, but why is Photosystem I most efficient at P700, and why are enzymes not consumed while catalyzing chemical reactions? The questions are never-ending, and though my young ignorance is frustrating, the novelty of learning something new is what attracts me to biology. It is a vast field of study with a plethora of unexplored areas that await for someone to discover them. Oh, the many possibilities! Just thinking about making a new discovery, a biological breakthrough, makes me nervous and excited! Yet before that, I need to become more acquainted with biology; that is where the Weiss School of Natural Sciences comes in. I want to explore the complex, fascinating inner life of cells and raise the current level of understanding in this field of science. Weiss School of Natural Sciences offers outstanding and creative educational programs for biology majors.

Additionally, experience gained with the hands-on research provided, be it on Plant Biology or Microbiology, will help me think outside the box, enhancing what I learn in lectures and textbooks. Like Rice as a whole, Weiss' mission to provide students with the best possible education and the wide range of research activities over which the BCB department spans, are most appealing.

{"id":115,"text":"In Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay \"The Conservative,\" he claims that the law doesn't affect heroes because they will do what is right no matter what. While the term hero is subjective, as not all people who break the laws are heroes, Emerson is correct to argue that to be truly just and great sometimes requires breaking the law. A common example of greatness is superheroes; their extraordinary physical abilities put to use to save the world from evil. However, their greatness sometimes conflicts with the law. For example, in Spiderman, Peter Parker choses to keep his identity a secret, to protect himself not only from paparatzi like J. Jonah Jameson (JK Simmons), but also from police. Though Spiderman is a hero at heart, he commits murder, puts people in harms way, and destroys buildings and public spaces. However, because he is a hero, he is able to \"outshine\" the law in order to continue to help and save the people of New York. Another example of sacraficial heroism is playing defensive soccer, only is this case the laws are the rules and breaking them is just a foul. A good defender knows that when their defense is outnumbered by the opposing attackers, their defense is out of position, or their goalie is out of position, you have to commit a foul. Though the foul gives the other team an opportunity to set up a potential scoring play, the sacrifice must be made in order for the defense to recollect and reorganize, allowing them to be better prepared for the attack. Though this form of heroism isn't as grand as Spiderman, breaking the \"laws\" of the game is still very important and generally considered to be the smarter play. Though Emerson's point is generally true, there are some faults, the most important one being that not everyone who breaks the law is considered to be a hero to everyone. Though this struggle can also be seen is Spiderman, a much better example is our former president, Donald Trump. Former President Trump has escaped paying taxes, began violent riots, and has even been impeached for using his position to attempt to take down a political rival (President Biden). In many Americans eyes, Donald Trump is not a hero but a villan who gained power by uniting his followers with rage, creating a cult of angry conservatives who follow his every order. However, to those who do support him, Trump is a hero who saved the USA from \"crazy liberals\" like Bernie Sanders and Hilary Clinton. There are hundreds of thousands of people who break the law who aren't heroes, like Donald Trump. On the contrary, in some cases, sometimes being a hero requires breaking the law in order to achieve equality. On of the greatest examples of law-breaking heroes is Gandhi, the Indian nationalist whose goal was achieving India's independence from the British. Gandhi, though he is considered to be one of the most respected role models for peace, was imprisoned 11 times for breaking British laws in India. He used his imprisonments to unite Indians to rise against the British government with non-violent protesting. Gandhi encouraged people to break the law in order to expose the horrible violence that the British inflicted on India. Gandhi was and is a hero to many and yet he broke the law hundreds of times. Being a true hero takes guts, compassion, and sacrifice, all of which support Emerson's idea that true heroes don't need to follow the law. Laws are created as a social contract, an idea which came from enlightenment philosophe Jean-Jaques Rousseau, who believed that the social contract bound our society together and kept people in check based on the morals and values of the community. The purpose of laws is to create equality for large amounts of people, an equality that stops people from doing whatever they want that could potentially disrupt society. However, humans are imperfect and because of that humans can create imperfect laws. One rule that Gandhi fought against was that Indians couldn't make their own salt from the ocean, they had to purchase it from the British, who had plainly taken the salt from India, sent it back to England to be processed, and then shipped it back to India to make a profit. Gandhi argued why must Indians buy british salt when we can make our own Indian salt right here? This law was clearly ridiculous: why should Indians have to buy British salt? It is because of imperfect laws that heroes, like Gandhi, should break the law and make their own salt. Sometimes breaking the law allows Spiderman to save the city from the Green Goblin, or allows the defense to organize and defeat their oposing attackers, or allows Gandhi to free India from the violent control of the British Empire. Yes not all who break the law are good, but heroes who break the law outshine the law in order to create more good and improve the world we live in.","label":"human"}

From that moment, my life was connected with drama. Walking in the tiny forest in my school, I read the script again and again, imagining how I should utter each word. Every night before I fell asleep, I would rehearse in my mind, trying to find faults in my performance. Suddenly, my life became vibrant, exciting and-well, full of drama. However, only after I became a director and co-producer did I realized what a drama really means: a giant project full of attractive challenges as well as trifling details. On one hand, I began to view the play from another perspective, caring for every subtlety of the whole play while plotting the framework of it. On the other hand, I have to work between our school's bureaucracy and our club, check about status of stage properties (i.e. changing broomsticks to swords), and plan for daily activities as well as communicate with our cast.

{"id":117,"text":"The first thing you must do is preheat your oven up as high as it will go. It takes longer than you think to heat your oven up all the way! You want to give your oven at least 30 minutes to preheat. If you have a pizza stone, make sure it's inside the preheating oven. For highend ovens, this can be up to 550 degrees F. For regular ovens, they are not going above 475 F. Pizza is traditionally cooked in 900 or 1,000 degree ovens. We can't get our ovens at home quite that hot, but we want to get as close as we can. Figure out what your oven can do and crank up the heat. Start out with about 12-16 ounces of dough. Any pizza dough, homemade or store bought, will work for this recipe. Place your ball of dough in the center of your work surface and use your hands to press it down, starting from the center. Keep gently patting out the dough, moving the dough outward from the center. I like to leave a pretty healthy crust on the edges of my dough. Continue patting and stretching the dough gently with your hands until it is about 12 inches across. Of course you can use a rolling pin if you want! (Use your hands to lift up the edges of the pizza when you are done to get more a lip for the crust.) At this point, transfer the dough to a square of parchment paper. I highly recommend using parchment paper because it's SO much easier transferring your pizza into the oven. Stretch and arrange the dough on the parchment paper. The dough shrinks a bit when you pick it up to transfer, just gently stretch it out again. Drizzle a bit of olive oil over the top of your dough. Use your hands or a pastry brush to rub the oil all over the top of the dough, especially the edges of the crust. This layer of oil helps the toppings stay separate from the dough, helping it cook more evenly. It also tastes delicious, especially on your crust. Once the oven is up to temperature, we are going to do a 1 to 2 minute par bake. Some of my favorite pizza toppings:\nJust Cheese: Any will work: Mozzarella, Fontina, Parmesan, and Gorgonzola would be amazing. Pepperoni\nMeat Lovers: Pepperoni, salami, Italian sausage, ham, bacon\nHawaiian: Canadian bacon, pineapple\nMargherita: fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, tomatoes\nBBQ: Use barbecue sauce instead of tomato sauce, then rotisserie chicken, red onions, bacon\nVeggie pizza: spinach, tomato, corn, peppers, red onion, mushrooms\nBuffalo: Use Frank's sauce instead of tomato sauce, then add rotisserie chicken, garlic, blue cheese, red onions\nOnce your pizza is in the oven, you need to cook it for about 8-12 minutes. This is of course going to depend on how hot your oven is, and how thick your pizza is. The crust should be golden brown, and the cheese should be bubbly and also starting to brown. If you don't have a pizza stone, use a spatula to lift the edge of your pizza to make sure that it is browning all across the center on bottom. If the bottom is still white, you are looking at a doughy pizza. Leave it in longer.","label":"human"}

This has necessitated discussions on its potential benefits and drawbacks for different students. Students' varied learning styles and their circumstances bartered different variables that saw schools expose both distance learning opportunities and various degrees of openness to it. Based on this, this essay will argue whether or not all schools should offer distance learning as an option for their students and how students with varying circumstances and learning styles can get the maximum benefits. First, distance learning results in some potential benefits for all students with various circumstances and learning styles because it offers flexibility. Through remote lecture format, learners can access academic material, speak academic language globally, and conveniently fit their learning into busy personal lifestyles. Actually, Cynthia Green from MakeHow institute adds up that learning programs customization's accommodate various students, causing content consignments absent from weaknesses situations inherent in physical classrooms exist peculiar checking except examination tasks virtually activate extant apnoeic learning platforms make distance transferable wayout.

{"id":121,"text":"The impact of technology on education is a hotly debated topic, and the use of cell phones during school hours is a frequent part of that debate. On the one hand, smartphones offer many potential benefits to students, from easy access to educational applications to enhanced collaboration tools. On the other hand, they can be a source of distraction and, in some cases, pose risks or hazards to students. My personal opinion is that cell phone use should be restricted during regular school hours, although it may be unwise to forbid their use altogether. While I think that students should generally leave their phones in their bags or other secure locations during class, there are cases where cell phones can assist in emergent situations. Several instances come to mind where students were able to alert emergency authorities for assistance due to immediate medical issues. Therefore; there should be restrictions but they should exist only for classes, not lunch time and other breaks but however this is easily mediable by limited internet usage. Because students may have reasons for using their cell phones during an emergency situation, rather than completely preventing cell phone use in schools, a limited-allowable situation of types of use is a favorable device restriction allowing students some freedom while addressing concerns ensuring their safety. The restriction should also consider whether the policy should be permanent or should vary dependant on certain time period's ether over a six month long semester or writing it in letter that shows beginning and the end of giving options that school debate clubs arrange. Ultimately, in classrooms that allow the use of phones, teachers can specify usage by weighing every teacher's technique through the exploitation of mobile devices. Meaning when writing class quizzes that students snap an image of necessary work by spacing out the allotted period of taking a photo with phone and implying this technique throughout class instead. Whatever that policy is, though, it may be a many-sided solution rather than releasing a stone sliding proclamation, the dictated restriction has questions on learners dominating their desire not to give phone automatically at school's day start, reducing too leniently permissible gaps and blending different internet usage requirements e.c.t\nIn the end, the optimum decision needs to focus mostly on educational methods properly","label":"ai"}

I owe it to myself... no, I owe it to at least someone, to someone who can remember the human legacy, if there even is one in the future, to write down what happened, to give at least some semblance to the horrors unfolding below me. I was always a starry-eyed child, looking at the heavens above and wondering, what's up there? And my dreams came true, first the flight school, then a military pilot, but everything made sense after my former instructor at the academy offered me a spot in the NASA Astronaut program. I couldn't believe it. I'm going to space? Really? A few hard years later I was a regular member of a mission flying back and forth between Earth and ISS. Sitting down on top of a rocket strapped down inside of a tiny capsule is not fun, I can tell you that, but the rush of adrenaline when you're stuck to your seat flying through the atmosphere never gets old. But this time, the feeling was - different. I arrived at the ISS on schedule and relieved my colleague Max. She was happy to see me, after all, 6 months spinning around the globe alone would do that to you. She was a dear friend of mine, but we didn't have much time for catchup and pleasantries. She was scheduled to go back on the same day, and left soon after - with a long goodbye. I always dreamed of a better world, where humans would work together for the betterment of mankind. I loved Star Trek as a child, a place where differences didn't matter and everyone was working for benefit of everyone. But we built a different world. A world of greed, a world of selfishness, a world where having more than others meant being better than another. We never really chose our leaders, or if we did, the fault is ours. A few years after the second pandemic, tensions rose. Rich were getting richer, the poor were getting poorer, and nothing was ever enough. And some people craved power. They wanted more. More land, more resources, more money. They launched their missiles first. At least it seemed that way from the media that was still running at the time. Didn't matter though, our defenses were inadequate. Watching through my tiny window I could see the planet burning. We, of course, fired back. I could see flash after flash hitting the ground. Cities burning. Billions dying. But in the end, it didn't matter. We all lost. Slowly, a massive cloud started covering the planet. It started from the places that were hit, but over weeks it spread throughout the globe. Once a beautiful pale blue dot is now nothing more that a grey patch in the sky. I could still hear some amateur radio stations from remote regions, trying to communicate and let someone know they are alive, but those were few and far between. Months later, they all died out. And now, I'm here, in the slowly decaying orbit of the International Space Station, alone, waiting for the replacement that will never come, thinking maybe Max was the lucky one.","label":"human"}

It caused me to look at life from a different perspective, because it says that you can love, and you can live but in the end, life will disappear into thin air. Before I heard this song for the first time, my entire life philosophy was built around putting as much in as I could possibly could, and that ultimately lead to a very stressful life for me.

{"id":126,"text":"The proposed solution of limiting car usage to 70 percent proposed by three citizen friends from Boston has both benefits and drawbacks. The significant advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in traffic congestion and pollution in the suburban lifestyle. Often, individuals rely on cars for short storage trips and issues, which results in high levels of traffic on the suburban roads. In that regard, a car usage limit would encourage individuals to explore other engaging or community activities that may not necessitate car trips. Consequently, suburban life will likely embrace walking, biking, and art pursuits that evoke energy-saving and environmental friendliness amidst declining abuse of private cars regularly.

{"id":129,"text":"Some schools may force their students to participate in something they don't want to, and that's just unfair to them. Nobody likes to be forced to do something in any scenario, especially kids who just want to relax and have fun. Students shouldn't have to participate in an activity it would cause to much pressure, they would lose their freedom too many kids might like the same thing and overload it. One thing that kids cherish the most about school is meeting new friends and hanging out with them after school, but extracurricular activities can get in the way of that. Kids should be able to do whatever they want after school instead of being forced to go to soccer practice. Kids have rights, just like adults and making them do something is a direct violation of their 1st Amendment rights. But some of them might like what their doing, and others don't. They shouldn't have to do something that they don't like to pass the grade That restriction of their freedom can also lead to too much pressure on their heads. Having to do something after school can interfere with free time for kids to work on their homework and unfinished school work Then, all of the sudden, middle school becomes a giant juggling game of sports and work, and it can really effect some kids with poor time-management skills. Constantly moving around to get everything done can cause a great deal of stress on the person handling it all. If you end up trying to handle one thing at a time, it can draw attention from everything else and cause even more stress than before. Another thing that may cause more stress is being surrounded by a lot of people that want the same thing as you. If you make an entire school do at least one thing, lots of them will have the same interest and it might overflow with participants With so many people for one specific thing, it might run out of equipment to use and will be very expensive to keep up, including damages. For sports teams, there are try-outs for who will make the team, and with so many people, they will have to compete harder for that spot on the team and may cause disputes or fighting. Also, with so many people trying out and so little spots open, lots of kids will get rejected and lose their self-confidence. Nobody likes to get rejected. Knowing that making students do an activity can restrict their freedom, cause pressure, and overflow one specific activity, what's the point in making them do it with so many disadvantages? If the students are stressed and under pressure, it might effect how well they do in school. Also, if there are too many kids and not enough equipment, who is going to pay for it? A good school is a happy school, where students can finish their work without being interrupted, roam the halls and have fun!","label":"human"}
{"id":130,"text":"As a child, gaming was essential to my existence. It was integrated into my life through education as well as entertainment. Gaming fabricated another reality that accompanied me through stressful and joyous times. When I entered high school, I desired to share my experience with others. With this in mind, I searched for individuals with analogous mindsets to establish our school's first Esports club. However, we were continuously looked down on for supporting what was perceived as detrimental to an individual's lifestyle, yet, I never perceived it that way. In fact, it was the opposite for me: gaming helped me achieve a better lifestyle because I used it as leeway to relieve my stress and build social connections with individuals throughout the school. Subsequently, I continued to persevere through the animosity and began hosting free entry community events to spread the message. For instance, for our first event, we hosted an online tournament that required a high degree of teamwork and leadership. I divided our tasks into three categories: marketing, sponsors, and cost. Correspondingly, we simultaneously secured a sponsorship with the game developers while advertising our tournament and determining the cost. As a result, we attracted over 100 participants and gained the respect from our school as we were invited to host a charity tournament. Moreover, I transitioned the club to a nonprofit organization, am now in charge of nationwide high school tournaments, and have garnered over 1200 members with devoted sponsors. Overall, I made an impact in the gaming community by introducing large free entry tournaments that provided opportunities for individuals to pursue their passion for gaming and develop everlasting friendships. Additionally, I developed leadership and teamwork skills that were ignited by my ambition and passion, and learned that pursuing one's passion is essential to developing one's character.","label":"human"}
{"id":131,"text":"Hello everyone! This is one of many college application essays I have to turn in within a couple of months or so. This prompt was one of the harder ones for me to write, so I'm posting it here in hopes that the community can help me with it! Thanks! Wilsonville -a place that you've vaguely heard of or a town that is your entire world. For me, it's all I've ever known. I've lived here as long as I can remember and knew nothing outside this little bubble. Many of my friends come from sheltered households who've never seen more than 5 people of different origins gathered in one place at any given moment. Fortunately for me, I had Korean parents. Through their stories, I quietly observed the bustling cities of Seoul and the calm farmlands in Non. They described the vibrant colors in silk of traditional Korean harbors, and the fast, elegant and percussive dance of Hugo. For them, Korea is the present, but for me, it was a thing of the past, my simple heritage. Although I was vastly different from my parents, the single thread of connection I had with them was Korea. It wasn't until when I was 15 that my small bubble was popped. I arrived with my brother, escorted by my grandparents at Inchon International Airport in South Korea. I didn't realize that we were on a completely different continent on Earth, miles away from home until we frantically searched for our luggage. It was an uneasy feeling. When we stepped outside to take a breath of the blissfully cool air, I forgot how to breathe. The sun glinted off of tall buildings that could puncture holes in the sky, streets filled with people with their own families, hopes and ambitions, restaurants lining the streets with wafting smells of exotic spices and foreign ingredients. There were sounds of angry drivers honking at traffic and hushed conversations people sitting outside while smoking cigarettes. The pictures of Korea in my history books only captured a grain of sand in the boundless beach. Grandpa hailed a yellow taxi and all of us squeezed in the cramped leather seat. With the air conditioner blasting cool air, he told us that there was only one public park in the entire city, he pointed at the river that made its way into the heart of the country, and he mentioned the local college that my father attended for his bachelor's degree in business. Not only did the tall diverse buildings fascinate me, it was the faces of the people roaming the streets. There were Koreans, Chinese, Japanese, Filipinos, Indians, Europeans, even Americans all of whom like me, wanted to experience the culture, taste the food and admire the buildings, traditional and modern, of a new country. It was crazy to wrap my brain around the fact that even within America, there are millions of people who come from all over the world with different cultures, traditions and heritages. In my visit to Korea, I met all my cousins, aunts and uncles, in-laws, and even great-grandparents who were around for nearly a century. It was in Korea that I discovered my passion to find a career for medicine and in helping others, my love of reading books - even if they're picture books in a language I can barely speak nonetheless read, and the joy of meeting new people all over the world.","label":"human"}
{"id":132,"text":"History is commonly perceived to be a study of dead things. Dead People, Dead Civilizations, Dead ideologies. The list can go endlessly. For me, however, there was something ensnaring about history. It was the one class I just couldn't wait for, whether it be 4th grade or 4th period in high school. History gave me something to think about because every lesson had a parallel in the real world. Almost automatically I was drawn towards history's unconventional answers, answers that rejected the obvious and searched for the intertwined and intangible truths. In fourth grade, I was the kid who loved history class because it is like story time, except with tests. But, what grabbed my attention was the teacher's fantastic stories of the Civil War especially his stories President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. A document my teacher heralded as a sign of Lincoln's hatred of slavery. One day in class, my hand shot up. I asked the teacher \"Why did President Lincoln want to free the slaves?\" He stared at me quizzically \"Um... I just answered that, slavery was bad, and he wanted to get rid of it.\" \"Then, why didn't he free them at the beginning of the war?\" I responded. My history teacher stared blankly at me. Years later, I came to recognize my search for the unconventional truth in history as a socially beneficial responsibility. As a student, I worked in the California New Born Screening Program; a program instituted to treat or prevent disorders is early childhood. Statistics in my lab revealed that Hispanic mothers and babies had a higher likelihood of refusing testing or simply ignoring protocol. What my superiors wrote off the occurrence as a cultural rift, the problem was something I could not ignore. In the twenties, President Herbert Hoover deported Hispanic individuals citing the same \"cultural rift,\" but through my history teacher's instruction, I was certain that both Hoover and the lab had overlooked the simplest of problems-communication. A week after I suggested that Spanish translators be used, local clinics reported a rise in the number of Hispanic mothers accepting testing. The unconventional answer for history was thus transformed into a modern answer for medicine. Cornell has always encouraged the unconventional answer and that is why I hope to study history at the university, but more importantly engage in the undergraduate research that Cornell augments its programs with. I would love to study the dynamics of race relations in the United States and the research opportunities that Cornell offer allow me to search for the unconventional answers I have dreamed of. But, better yet, Cornell provides me the ability to not just study, but implement what I have learned. I plan on taking full advantage of the \"Cornell in Washington\" program, so that I may work towards social responsibility by encouraging change in public policy. History has never been dead for me. In fact, history can easily influence the future and I want to be part of the process, every step of the way.","label":"human"}

If you work hard at making yourself interesting to yourself, your time in school will be the most energizing and others will also find you interesting at the next level, whether that be an employer, grad school, med school, law school, etc. Given this philosophy, narrate how you would create a space (literal or figurative) for honors students to make themselves interesting. Would you create a course (you can do that in honors!)? A club? A physical space? A field trip? What would you do? Whom would you involve? How would it be inclusive of honors students in a variety of majors? How would you encourage other honors students to be interested in their own unique way? Limited to 1500 characters. Response:There is no medium for self-expression quite like comedy as humor is the one thing that anyone can do and everybody enjoys. Like nothing else, comedy brings people together from all walks of life as they are rolling on the ground, struggling to get air. With that said, I believe that humor is the ultimate means of making oneself interesting. Therefore, if given the opportunity, I would create a club dedicated to allowing students to express themselves through humor. Such a club would feature open mic sets to encourage students with comedic inclinations to make themselves interesting whilst entertaining their fellow students. Performances would be informal and would likely be focused on the shared experiences of life at Virginia Tech. A strong sense of humor and passion for making others laugh adds a dimension to an individual's personality and in my opinion makes them more unique, interesting individuals. The opportunity to preform provided by such a club could allow students to discover a passion for humor or even realize a childhood dream. I believe that honors students would thrive if given such an opportunity as their quick wit and unique life experiences are comedic goldmines. In my experience, the smartest people are the funniest. A comedy club would be inclusive to honors students of all majors as I am willing to bet my acceptance into honors that everyone loves a good laugh. Hopefully, attending or participating in occasional comedic performances would provide honors students with relief from the inevitable stress of perusing an honors degree. My response is currently about 1600 characters, so it still needs to be trimmed down a little Thank You","label":"human"}

One main reason for the growth of popularity is that cell phones give us the ability to reach any person in a matter of seconds almost effortlessly. The technology of the cell phone has dramatically changed, for example Apple and their extraordinary enhancements to their devices over time. Cell phones are a necessity but not before your life or anyone else's. More than 1.5 million deaths occur a year due to cell phone use while driving. Cell phones should never in any case be more important than the road while you are driving. Drivers should definitely know to never use cell phones while driving, especially for a text. Cell Phones provide communication with convenience, but they also have many other perks including cameras,games, etc. Cell phones can have many different uses, all of which can be very useful but at the right time. There are multiple ways in which a driver can be distracted while driving. They include talking to passengers, lighting up a cigarette and smoking,eating and drinking, etc. None of these have caused more deaths than distraction by cell phone in the USA. It is important to note that distracted driver attention by mobile phones means driving and talking at the same time, which raises safety threats. Drivers have to control both the vehicle and the mobile phone which makes focusing on the road a lot more difficult. Drivers who use cell phones while driving not only endangers themselves but also other people on the road. As a result, most governments, including Austria, Australia, Switzerland and many more have created strict policies on phone use during driving. Due to lack of attention, drivers react slowly to traffic signals, sometimes missing. Decision making during driving is very important. Being distracted gives drivers a fraction of a second to make a quick decision in an intense scenario. Studies have highlighted that cell phone drivers react a lot slower and are more likely to make a mistake on the road. Due to the statistics it can be concluded that, despite being a revolutionary way of communication, the use of cell phones during driving distracts the attention of the driver dramatically and puts lives at risk.","label":"human"}

I want to be able to give my own opinion on certain issues and learn from the different perspectives of my peers. Furthermore, I want to be able to see the world in a light I had never imagined. Penn makes this possible for me. Although Penn's student body is academically gifted, the beauty of it is that these same students are not bound to the classroom. Penn's students are also musicians, athletes, Greeks, and above all, human. I've been to some colleges where the students seem like robots with the same routine: eat, study, sleep, and repeat. At Penn, this is not the case. The great involvement of the student body attracts me greatly. I want to be able to give back to the community through service, play sports, and be able to make friends all while working hard academically. The opportunities for involvement beyond the classroom at Penn are parallel. At Penn, students are able to join groups that range from teaching others to embrace cultural differences to groups such as Alternate Spring Break, a group that offers community service trips to various locations across the country. Penn's emplacement of the notion that school is not all about academics distinguishes it from the other elite institutions of the nation. As an aspiring applicant to the College of the Arts and Sciences, I am excited for all the opportunities such an education would provide for me. I look forward to being stimulated mentally from world renowned professors and to take advantage of tools such as peer advisors and other students to learn more about myself and others. At the CAS, I will be able to combine studies from my economics major with other subjects such as calculus, literature, and various other subjects. This flexibility that Penn provides as part of its program promotes the intellectual growth of an individual. Unlike at other institutions, Penn allows students to wander through the various fields of academics in order to expand knowledge and to gain insight in other fields that would not have been possible if students were bound to one major. If I am accepted, I would strive to play a pivotal role in this cultured learning experience. I would talk to other students about my studies and will be able to exchange knowledge with my peers. This exchange of intellectual findings not only promotes my growth as a student, but also helps the student body mature intellectually as well. I firmly believe that learning shouldn't be bound to just classroom lectures. I have found in my research that Penn also holds this same idea. True learning comes not just from professors, but also from an active student body. At Penn, the best of both worlds are combined in order to form an experience that remains eternal for those that walk through the Franklin Field Gates at The University of Pennsylvania.","label":"human"}
{"id":139,"text":"The covid pandemic has stirred a global shift from traditional in-person classroom settings to online learning systems. However, it's necessary to comprehend whether online learning systems have replaced the traditional in-classroom learning experience, with emphasis on social interaction, hands-on learning, and school experience. In my opinion, a physical in-classroom learning experience is the ideal way of educating students due to its indisputable development of important skills, intellectual, and social benefits. Various sorts of proof demonstrate that pupils profit more from physical interactions. An earlier understanding of the classroom learning experience was the formal type, described as lecture-based and outlined rules that could make discipline rather violent. But newer approaches have shifted to accommodate contemporary means of education delivery and embraced developmental activities that promote knowledge retention. As presented in Jim Murphy, this idea claims fleshed-out advantages where learners experience better study material control, availability of on-hand kits in the laboratories, sophisticated instruments that aid interactive introduction, and availability of mentoring (Murphy, 2020). Argumentatively, traditional methods of instruction focus on station-by-station presentations and hence differ regardless of the institution, superior learning result tends to be realized via personalized classroom instruction. Arguably, acquiring lessons in person creates an authentic living learning exchange, as per observed in a classroom setting. The indispensability of student presence at campus extends behold its academic uniqueness; pupils have a tendency of molding healthy relations installed on perennial teaching experiences coupled with group activities since such isn't possible in online clustering. Interaction increases concurrently with proficiency development strategies that flanks teachers enrol their students creatively reciprocals to their discernibilities (Fullan & Langworthy, 2014). Fortifying influence towards student operation surveys verify a 98% focus degree matching face-to-face essay submission scenarios, showcasing physical lectures absolute in precision over solely entirely independent work-from-home provisions. Online learning methods come with massive drawbacks to the social growth and integration of students. Traditional classroom teaching experiences worth laudable sets children on the keener bearing since it encourages immediate readiness towards team dynamic functional schooling components professed by psychologists, comprising aptitude development aptness health training disparities (Statista Research Department, 2021). Mr Brandon Naidu conducts teaching programs virtually, and it creates a minor axis of intersocial exposure amounting from focus associated conditions posing grievous animosity towards traditional ideal social proxies educational entrenchments contain. Hence, while classmates appear meaninglessly in online learning exchanges, traditional traditions call for humans practicing nurturance in communities naturally laid up in grades submerged view or clique under shun conditions without it feeling like demanding efforts curiously corresponding to coexistence. Opting for online learning methods poses limits to the ethos and scope of professional monitoring and training as instructors can gain after-action-out-briefings via activities' digital doubles, pupils proficient numerical units aren't near complete immersion syndicates considerably lacking communicative adjustive parallels.

From massive rovers tracing the planet's terrain to high-resolution satellite imagery scrutinizing its terrain, scientists are feverishly studying everything Martian. With such extensive research and various findings of possibilities on Mars, one question still remains - Is there life on Mars? To answer this question, astronomers have searched for clues on the planet's surface and in its windblown dust. The evidence from various sources suggests that there could be life on Mars. The landmark study of \"Unmasking the Faces on Mars\" is considered the prominent source analyzing the planet's topography in detail. These faces may be a natural feature of the planet and due to weather conditions, such as storms interfering with the pictures perceived. However, it might also be incorporated evidence that offers assessments of extraterrestrial rock formations. One such was found in 1996 - meteorite 'ALH84001' slashed life on Mars' concept all over traditional practices. While this finding is not conclusive by any means, there are other promising aspects. For example, evidence suggests that water exists on Mars, a vital requirement to sustain life as we know it on Earth. Furthermore, rovers sent by NASA to Mars have discovered organic molecules, around the GRS Crater, thought to be proof of how life once exists under suitable conditions. These factors indicate that trialed observation conducted actively on the Martian region now includes limitations, significant events can provide interesting results. Despite this, the absence of extra evidence stamps the brainchild theory whether life exists on Mars seems innovative rather than founded on fact. Furthermore, it has to be proved immutably beyond the examination problems of labeling operational data gathered by assorted UAV (Usage-vanity activists) too rhetorically dominating, destructively provided.\" In conclusion, with the ever-increasing search for habitable planets and life beyond Earth, scientific research on Mars offers cogent argumentation if life exists on Mars","label":"ai"}

I believe that you should select policy number one. You want the children to look forward to coming to school, instead of feeling like they are forced to go someplace they dislike. Giving the students the right to use cell phones during lunch periods and other free times will give them the personality that you long to see. Also, if the students want to come to school more often that will have a huge affect on Count Day. If cell phones are used during these free times, i don't really think there will be a disturbance to other students\/staff members. Another, If students from other schools discover the new policy at our school district, they will want to transfer to the district to have these rights. Cell phones have been banned from schools for as long as i can remember; they should experiment with something new, since many generations are passing up the opportunity to still be in school, and just say, \"I never wanted to go to school, but I finished.\" The only thing is that I don't know what the parents of the children would say. Some might agree with the idea and won't mind their kids using cell phones in school, but some might disagree and want their kids to not be distracted during school, and to just learn the curriculum that the school has to offer Many people are going to have different opinions, so the best thing to do is to take a poll for this matter. A poll where students and parents vote for what they believe should happen with this whole cell phone policy. Therefore, my opinion is to choose policy one, where kids can use cell phones during free time. Let the students have some fun. But, it's your decision, you're the principal of this school, not me.

Especially, when it's are related to your career, education, or personal life. Every decision comes with its set of implications, and as such, it's imperative to weigh the options available to make informed decisions. Seeking advice from multiple sources is, therefore, crucial in making the right decisions. In this essay, we'll examine the importance of seeking advice from multiple sources. When seeking advice from multiple sources related to decision-making, you gain multiple perspectives and insights that broaden your understanding while also helping when it is time to balance information or make a crucial verdict. For example, you might require career advice that nurses argue while the journalist friend argues from the layman's perspective. You'll weigh their reasons, expectations, and potential all together carefully as much as you would like to hear which friend clues into whatever thought process that has stopped you moving forward or holds you back in your essays furthermore; these friends come with an unique way to add them what secrets and surprising details which your issues may go with unapproached whether rooted scientifically or rooted emotionally from where the assistance should begin on handling your issues. When you rely on only one person for advice, you will likely only receive a single perspective that might not necessarily answer all your questions leading to regretful decision-making down the line.

{"id":144,"text":"Exploring Venus has been an area of interest for space scientists ever since it was first discovered. Many believe that an expedition to this planet is a necessity, for a number of reasons. The potential benefits and risks that come from exploring this planet provoke possible advancements in technology, which the human race can reap benefits from. However, there are various limitations and challenges that arise while exploring the second planet from the sun. In this essay, we will explore the the potential benefits and risks of exploring Venus, points the author raises about Venus being similar to the Earth, challenges that Venus presents for exploration, current limitations for exploring Venus, innovations being made to overcome these limitations, and a final reflection on whether exploring Venus is worth the risks involved. The Challenge of Exploring Venus article by Eric Berger highlights the various boons of exploring Venus, presenting an argument that extends far beyond abandoning the planet and moving forward in intergalactic explorations. The dearth of information regarding Venus necessitates exploring the planet for economic, strategic, argumentative, academic, and cultural reasons. Furthermore, pro exploring recommendations discuss vital innovation implications of Venus exploration, given that it can advance research and development by impressively accelerating at an inordinately cheaper cost initially when compared to interplanetary touring aspirations. Fern Munoz from NASA, an ESA PAO, states that exploring Venus will help us come one step nearer to revealing Earth's potential. As Berger explains, Venus bears dissimilarities to Earth, consisting of differences including gravity, length of a megalithic technological era and time resemblance that will affect strategies, and equipment use to intensify life tolerability at night These differing statistics could greatly help and lead to tinkering that gives a promising portend for space research. Additionally, the unique subsea immiscibilities made Venus Earth's most significant minor, or first-world space-worthy sample dome.

You may have thought it was created by aliens I am here to tell you that it's just a mesa. in 1976 we discovered something on Mars that looked like a face! At first we thought it was something like what you think now, we thought it was aliens The excitement was short lived for us because we ended up saying that \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa\" so that made it disappointing for us. You may say that the landform is created by aliens and we're just hiding it from you, but you're sorely mistaken because this discovery would help NASA as a whole if we did reveal it. That's just one of many reasons that we aren't lying about it being a landform. Another reason that we are completely sure it's a landform is because we can't spot any sign of life on the face As we said \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,\" \"So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" So even if you thought we were lying saying \"Oh this image is a lie they have secret ones that actually show that there's life on Mars in their building, you would have no clue that there's no reason for us to hide life being on Mars We wouldn't have anything bad happen to us because we discovered life on Mars we would get rewarded for discovering life on Mars so why would we hide it? And the last reason is that we have factual evidence and credibility to back up that there's no life on Mars Like we said during this speech we said that \"And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform.\" Later on we did it again in the speech \"Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001- a cloudless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. \"We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,\" Said Garving. \"Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.\" \"Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" Now you may say that we never did that, but we have photographic evidence of that clear photo that lets you see everything on the face. So we have the evidence we need to prove that this photo is real.

They can teach you life skills, give you experience for future events or jobs, and they can help you stay healthy, These activities are also good for your mentality. Extracurriculars are important because they play a role in our society that takes care of younger generations, and with few exceptions, should be mandatory. Sports are common examples of such activities. Many people love playing them, they have fun, and they learn something new. Most sports teach you about teamwork and how to help better your team. Everybody learns together, finds out what they're good at, and executes their jobs. Sports also help you find self-worth. Sports can help find a passion for something you didn't know you had. They can ignite a fire inside you and push you towards your goals, just as you push yourself. Sports are also good for your free time. When you have sports on your schedule, it always gives you something to look forward to, maybe even a constant in your life. Having these items on your calendar can also give you a feeling of satisfaction and content. As well as sports, fitness in general is something to keep you moving. If you need motivation, just work out. Staying fit always keeps you healthy. It also makes you happier. The sensation of working hard in a workout creates a chemical reaction in your brain, making you happier. If you need help getting over something, it will get you through your problems by distracting you and making you content. Staying fit can also be a great confidence booster in the sense that you can feel ready to do anything after you've finished whatever it may be that you're doing. Another thing after school activities are good for is interaction. It's sounds simple, but that's because it is. Simply interacting with other people in some sort of project can get you to collaborate with people you didn't know before. Depending on what you're doing, something you learn in an activity may become useful you later on. It could be an enlightening experience to help you in the future. Such activities also increase your socialization. This is good, especially for anybody participating that usually goes through things by themselves anyway. You can make a lot of friends and have great conversations if you take the time to talk to the new people you're working with, no matter what it is. To finish off, these are the three reasons extracurricular activities are good for people. Sports, fitness, and basic interaction teach you many things and they can all be achieved in your free time. Stay active, stay healthy, stay happy. Whatever you learn once may be used again in the future, you just need to remember how to use your knowledge to your advantage.","label":"human"}

This proves costly youth education expense doesn't really matter, which I have always agreed with. That's why I sack a costless host family in America. The host family I found on the Internet was actually quite overwhelming to adjust when I lived with them. A part of reasons was that I didn't pay any money, causing financial difficulty to them. However, through the experience with the family, I learned how to overcome obstacles I faced throughout my high school career in America. The family members in themselves were nice, but the environment in the house bothered me. Located on outskirts, the house was small, I slept in an office room, neighbors were not wholesome, and my unclear-headed host mother wanted me to open windows in winter. The fact that the children have committed serious crimes even scared me. Those issues were too harsh for a young international student who just came from the other side of the world. Awkwardness also existed in the household between my host parents and me since I didn't pay for hosting, although they volunteered to do it for free. However, I never gave up my faith in the family since they were willing to have me in their house. Reminding me of the British statistic helped too. With challenging spirit, I tried to respect house rules, their expectations, and most importantly, each of the family members. I passionately worked on keeping a good relationship with the family. At the end of the school year, I had to gulp back tears as they held a little goodbye party for me. Looking back, I learned a very valuable lesson without any cost. This reality led me to seek for an American family later when I decided to transfer to another school in Pennsylvania. With paying much more money, I could stay in a Korean hosting house where I didn't have to think about cultural difference and feeling awkwardness, but I rather chose to be with natives.

Help me out! -------------\"Why do snails leave such an okey-dokey trail, Mr. Patrick?\" the girl asked, standing on the tippy-toes of her light-up Sketchers to observe the snail terrarium. Using her curiously large, electric-blue eyes as tools, she dissected the habitat. \"The slime helps them move faster, Amelia,\" I explained, after quickly reading her freshly-written name tag. She gave a slight smile, withdrew a miniature magnifying glass from her denim pocket, and trudged deeper into her snail examination. I looked at the ground. It was the morning of Monday, July 27th, 2009, and my volunteer teaching week at River Legacy Science Center was just beginning. Although I was thrilled to help teach a roomful of 2nd graders about various slimy creatures, I couldn't help but be distracted by my thoughts of the future. Merely three weeks stood between me and the first day of ninth grade. The ninth grade. The first year that everything actually counted. Worries about perfecting my high school GPA and class rank swarmed the back of my fourteen-year-old mind. How was I going to earn the stellar statistics required to achieve success in my upcoming high school education? I looked up and tried to refocus my thoughts back to the eager Amelia, who was still fixated on the snail.\" Did you find anything interesting?\" I asked.\" Of course!\" she chirped. \"Look at how the snail moves towards the dark! Do you think he likes the dark? I can't stand the dark! Dirt is dark. Does he like dirt? EW, dirt!\" Considering I am now seventeen, and still sleep with the bathroom light on, it's safe to say we found some common ground.\" Yes, Amelia, snails love the dark,\" I said, halfway chuckling. As the week progressed, my fellow volunteer teachers and I marveled at her enthusiasm. Yes, other kids in the class asked questions. But none quite as fervently as Amelia. She never ceased to discover something new. Even during free-time, while other kids played hopscotch and nibbled on Villa Wafers (my personal favorite snack), Amelia bounced around the room, fully immersing herself in her educational opportunity. But what was driving her? Why was she pursuing her education so tenaciously? She had no grades to keep up with, no final exams to ace. And then I understood. She was gorging herself, but not with Villa Wafers. She was feasting on knowledge. Her only goal was to satisfy her hunger to learn. Maybe I could learn from this. I had entered that week expecting to be a static, knowledgeable teacher, but left feeling like a well-taught student. Amelia, my eight-year-old teacher, taught me how to discover. She showed me how to whip out my magnifying glass and take an active interest in my education. From that week on, I have let my curiosities and passion for learning propel me to academic success. If I supply my thirst for knowledge, the important numbers and statistics will take care of themselves. So, whenever I'm in AP Calculus, and I ask that perfect question that sets off my lightbulb, I thank Amelia. \"","label":"human"}
{"id":154,"text":"In my earlier days-throughout most of my teenage years, actually- I resented the quiet and simple nature of my hometown-the tiny village of Leland located on the \"baby finger\" (Leelanau Peninsula) of Michigan. Leland has a population of about 7,000 during the summer months, while the winter population just barely tops out over 2,000 people. I frequently wished I could have grown up somewhere urban or exotic-exciting and chock-full of blatantly obvious inspiration. I constantly resented my parents for choosing such a dull place to settle down, imagining myself thriving in the multiculturalism of a metropolitan area, while instead, I found myself surrounded by what I thought were the most average of settings. Feeling trapped by the fields of hay, staring down row after row of cherry trees in perfect lines, and boxed in by the isolating Great Lakes, covered in a monotonous blanket of snow for the better half of the year, I wondered what I had done to deserve such tedium. But, as of late, I have matured to realize that I have been trained, in a sense, to find the beauty in everything, turning what I once saw as ordinary into extraordinary. I have come to embrace my surroundings, appreciating every small thing around me, realizing that the time I have left in my hometown is quickly running out. Fields of hay have sprouted into amber waves of grain. Repetitive cherry trees have blossomed into beautiful orchards brimming full of adventure. The once isolating lakes covered in harsh sheets of ice have melted into life-giving bodies of water for which I am most grateful. Although my peers and I have not been blessed with the academic opportunities large high schools offer (my graduating class will consist of approximately 30 students), any Leland Public School student can assure you we definitely make the most of what we are given, not just in the classroom but outside as well. The enchanting ability to discover the beauty in anything that I feel will influence my future decisions and will help shape me into a better, more caring adult capable of enjoying the small and more important things in life. It is this impeccable ability to discover beauty in common activities and everyday life that has leaded me to anthropology. Through various academic courses and photographing as a hobby, I have begun to merge photography and anthropology into one. Although these two extremely different studies might not seem to have anything in common, to me, they go hand-in-hand. How can you take a photograph of a person without capturing who they are, where they've been, or what they are trying to be? Every subject has his or her own personal story, struggle, or tale, and every photograph is taken with the goal of capturing this individual story, of which I simply cannot get enough. 45` 1' 26\" N 85` 45' 35\" W: Leland, Michigan.

{"id":156,"text":"Whenever we find ourselves faced with a dilemma or struggling to make a decision, we often turn to those around us for advice. Seeking multiple opinions has been shown to be an incredibly valuable approach to decision-making, as it allows us to gain different perspectives and gather a more comprehensive understanding of our situation. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of seeking multiple opinions when asking for advice and how it can lead to better decision-making. Using multiple examples of situations where seeking multiple opinions is beneficial, I will also underline the importance of considering one's own advice in the decision-making process. Collaborating with others and seeking wisdom for essential decisions is an important part of the problem-solving process because it involves taking many perspectives and ideas to benefit from collective intelligence. There is a popular adage that says \"Two heads are always better than one\", referring to the idea that working with another person will help generate positive results. This phrase has withstood the test of time and become a common expression, particularly in fields where groups of people frequently pool ideas. Additionally, studies show that collaborating and actively seeking multiple viewpoints outperform jury members who function academically without communicating with one another. This technique triggers enthusiasm and creativity to identify problems from several different angles, hence generating bold ideas, as everyone shares a mixture of expertise, context, backgrounds, and domains of inquiry to combine across genres. Seeking support and advice from others enable supportive and reliable viewpoints in making our noble decisions. Collaborating with others also keeps spirits high, maintains public morale, and unsuppressed emotions in task scheduling. Incomes are broadened as better-performing employees act as drawbacks and resistance in making decisions, inhibiting good performance and active participation from either co-partner or management. Let us embody this notion by illustrating an example whereby attaining specific ends would be unique by incorporating several views. To consider it through critical analysis, personnel goes through discussions on detecting a trap desired alternative way of achieving aims, adds her specific point of view and senses against particular opposing perspectives, discussing interim choices that one should recognize, steps improvement, and ways of remaining objective when confronting bias, besides assessing adequacy criteria for policies concerning what they approve, profitability, homogeneity, tactics, and experiments. Collaborating and co-triggering advice from others help with enhancing strengths in studies proved accurate fruition of performing together to come up with better ingenuity compared to being atomistic learning bureaus without any interesting interaction from acquaintances when learning. Forecasting group and individual economic fluctuations utilizing primary knowledge are obtainable in different people's forecasts offering those making increasingly better decisions through expanded visibility: adopting a sympathetic structure (friendly as well) in solidarity purposes; dealing with conflicts to promote collaboration, retaining steady practicing for reliable ideas, choices, options, and exploiting group identification mechanisms. Actively seeking multiple opinions is allows individuals to better understand differing perspectives and gain insight that they might not have otherwise encountered. Humans interpret guiding truth and information presented to them have knowledge about and then ascertain decision results. Diverse experiences, ongoing education and appealing scenarios enable individuals disregarding other informative guide voices facilitated through group versions. One might infer whether one shouldn't obstruct suboptimal specialized experts as mediators throughout anticipating extreme precaution since this alternative often gives disputants more problem-solving situation prominence. It also has a basis throughout expressing one further perspective clarification where outcomes of troubles motivate cogent and full representation. Developing skills in crisis management, since debates from a couple taking group options get advantage from working openly expressing aloud whenever attaining disparate underpin sum alternatives exchanging here options to show that winning relies on the spirit of interdependence moderates any form of plural instance simultaneously. Many have failed in their attempts to dispute exploring decisions use information multiple sources but instead by interacting with prior actions review platforms or explicit authorities discussed leaders in panel boards, unhelpful biases produced regarding exclusive solutions and oversimplified decision templates. Overemphasizing discrepancies that acquire few of representation by studying expressive change agents promotes group solidarity sometimes. Alternatively, successful on getting adequate acquaintance clarifying progress achievements boosts strict cooperative skills from unforeseen supporting unsympathetic alternative points of criticizing looking at presenting various genuine, unmatched claims and argument deliverances reflected sincerely with impactful relatable strategies that lead to positive and meaningful influences. Therefore, multiple opinions expose flaws until all parties. Besides working outward discussions, sharing unease understandable individual concerns lays a foundation as initially deriving terms solving adversaries' structure by exposing when partnerships thought of from distinct discernment value comprehend negation of ignorant disputes as they arise frequently among innovations from informed judgement of expressing improvement ideal aspects indicative of perfecting social conflict resolution. The Importance of [Name] advice. Although seeking multiple opinions outside ourselves is important, it would increase to the level of paramount for pragmatic approaches when looking for ways to generate major better judgments in different avenues, especially since lateral collaboration styles with peers generate do-less-best intentions enticing others than associatively reactive responsibility, fostering protection mechanisms default sides during incentivizing of dissent plus emerging clear-cut occurrences by having best-reported scenes indeed present statistical inference in improving associations. Detouring advice generation upon external individual perspectives manifests contingency and independence values toward constructing satisfactory opinion premises regulating meaningful discoveries below specific constraints.

The excitement from just a mere ten minutes before had dissolved and was now replaced by a sense of dread I had felt too many times before. It was too late to stop the stylist who was by this point wielding a pair of scissors in one hand and a lock of my hair in the other. As the layering and cutting progressed it only become more and more apparent that I couldn't have chosen a worse haircut for my face. The choppy layers and blunt bangs that the aforementioned magazine said would \"frame my face and highlight my cheekbones\" instead made my head look freakishly oval. The length was another issue altogether as the shortcut exposed all of my neck, which now looked like it was more akin to that of a giraffe than of a human. \"Well, you can always put it in a ponytail!\" exclaimed my mother upon laying eyes on my new do. If only this were the case. It would have taken dozens of bobby pins, gallons of hairspray, and maybe even a small crane to get all the short layers into anything that resembled a ponytail. I wish I could say that my classmates reactions were any better than my moms, but sadly I was met with the same reassuring remarks about how fast hair grows out and how many ways there are to pin bangs up with barrettes. Needless to say, I sat out the upcoming middle school social and opted to watch reality TV for the evening instead. Though the experience was borderline traumatic for my middle school self my reputation and I managed to come out of it intact. After several weeks the horrendous situation on my head managed to grow out into a hairstyle someone might willingly have, and I was able to attend social events again. I learned a lot of lessons from that haircut, one of them being never trust a magazine that suggests you ever wear a poncho or mix different animal prints \"just to be edgy\" and the other is that it's important to be yourself and try sometime different every once in a while. Even though this particular haircut didn't work out for me, I did manage to differentiate myself and ended up keeping a somewhat shorter more sophisticated style. I admit that a little part of me is glad I went out on a whim and got what is hopefully the first and last bad haircut of my life.","label":"human"}

While some argue that this policy may promote academic growth and physical activity among students, others argue that it could potentially discourage students from participating in sports. On one hand, implementing this policy can foster academic success as student-athletes will be motivated to work harder in the classroom. Balancing academics and sports can be challenging for any student, and requiring a minimum grade can emphasize the importance of academic performance. Moreover, as sports practice and games become more rewarding activities, pupils are motivated to reach the required grades. They may choose more cautiously how they invest their spare time and put in additional effort in their studies and physical activity. On the other hand, fears arise as implementing punishments of requiring such policies could demotivate targeted learners and inflict stress. However, the inclusion sentiment provides encouragement, coaching, and should hearten undesirable teacher criticism from targeted undertainty.

Precarious driving can cause serious harm to oneself and others as the mind does not pay attention to the road and thus increases the chances of crashing.

What about this quality or accomplishment makes you proud, and how does it relate to the person you are? It's been 4 years since I have come to America to start my new life. In these four years, I have come to work for my dad in his market every Sunday. During the holidays or long weekends, I've always been here, in the market, working hard for my dad. At first, I was rejecting the idea of working with my dad due to his scary personality, but later on I started to think coming to work as an experience that I can learn a lot from. The first job I've done in my dad's market is a cashier. I thought it was fun to count the items and accept cash. Yet due to some customer's complaint my dad got mad at me doing a cashier's job, and he forbid me to do so. I was feeling very dejected at that time, my excitement for work gone down to zero. Later as I grew up, my dad slowly and gradually gave me work to do. I then slowly adapt myself into my dad's world and learn how to survive in it. I still make some mistakes like sometimes I messed up on counting the money, and some customers are nice enough to remind me the extra money I gave them; I was very grateful to those customers. Yet my dad and some customers are not so nice to me, they scolded me strictly and warned me there is no next time for me. I was very scared and did not want to continue to be here, but I have nowhere else to go, so I gritted my teeth and continue to endure. I start to found out about the other side of our customer and how ugly they can be when I start to cash checks. Furthermore, I have seen a lot of people who lived with meager money that they make out of their job and struggle with it. He taught me a lot about psychology and how people act through this exercise. I learned how to observe people, decide what should be done and have confidence in myself. I realized that in every place always have somebody that dominates and control that place, like my dad's market is his own world that he carved out with his own hand. In this world, my dad is the King; whatever he said is the rule of this world. As for me, I am just a person who does not have my own place yet. I liked how my dad has his own world that he can live in. Thus, I decided that someday I will carve out my own niche and live comfortably in it, with nobody saying no to me or my action. My dad said, the most important thing is to not let others look down on you, because if they do, they will pressure you to give out more and in the end you'll be the one left with nothing. He told me the stories of his customers and what had leaded them into that path. He showed me some examples of a miserable life through our customer, some of them have a very sad life due to their personality and habits. Sometimes I heard the news about our customer die due to violence. I saw how these young mothers struggle to live their life with little money and a child to take care of. I've seen those people who put their whole life on betting their money to nothing. Furthermore, I witnessed people who stole something just for the sake of their own enjoyment. Furthermore, I shivered on the thought of me being like them, so I resolved to live a better life and take good care of myself. Furthermore, I still have a long road waiting for me to walk on. What I have seen and learned in this market became a part of me, they will be the lesson I looked upon when I lived my life and how I solve this problem is how I am.","label":"human"}

Well, I know if I was stuck on making a really tough decision, I would turn to people I trust. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better decision other people may be wiser they may have been in the same situation they may have a different point of view on things Sometimes, looking for other opinions can help somebody stay out of a detention center or jail If most were stuck in a situation like that, they would turn to multiple opinions. Who would not? If a person has more knowledge, they can help make a better decision with a better outcome. that is like an Eagle teaching its babies how to hunt and track down food without dying. Other people also may make better choices, which then lead them to being successful and not get in trouble An example of this is widely used in schools across America and especially at my school. Students ask other students and friends questions different assignments. This can be good because if someone has already been through something, they are more capable of passing good information on to somebody else. And students are not the only group of people who use methods like these, it happens in everyday life. Online reviews of restaurants and stores is also a good example of how other opinions can help someone make a better decision. If a family was looking for a good place to eat because they were really hungry, they could look at the reviews and other people's opinions to help them make a better decision on where to spend their hard earned money. It is always helpful to get an opinion through someone else's eyes. Some people's brains do not function the same and others may think differently than some. But what may seem stupid and wrong to some may sound fantastic and right to others. I feel like seeking multiple opinions from others is the best way to make a better decision. It is not mandatory that people ask for other's opinions to help make a better decision but it is very helpful and may have a better outcome. I think that every person should seek another's opinion, but they do not have to if they do not want to. Finding other's opinions can also help a lot of trouble makers in school, teens disobeying their parents, and adults making bad decisions that send them to jail.

However, concerns arise about the appropriateness of students' clothing, despite their need to feel comfortable while they enjoy the healthy activities provided in the school. Providing students with sports uniforms, such as gym shorts and indoor running shoes, could be an effective way of mitigating this clothing issue. Additionally, policies concerning dress codes that outline the educational needs of appropriate dress could be enforced, maintaining moral standards, and making exemplary compromises with the populace. Another concern rises about how students can reconcile the need to maintain superior academic strides and still participate actively in extracurricular activities adequately. Pooling sports, debates, and science fairs into concerted efforts or collaborative catalogues openly broadcasting the scheduled programs could help define platforms where pupils can discuss respective extracurricular options with educators and receive pointers and critiques as special instructional programs eliminate schedule-oppression. Lastly, important efforts could include investing in more student clubs for inspirational purposes like environment and human right, various departments promulgate student-cleaning-squads which, in addition to cleaning school facilities and decluttering classrooms, will manage to yield unlimited applications capable of business emulation.

As I put my headset on and was ready to play the PowerPoint, I was quite amused for my first job as a backstage crew member for my school's Annual Spring Musical. With an immense responsibility in my hands, I started the PowerPoint to signal the start of the show. With the laughter and excitement in the audience tone, I was quite satisfied that the show was going on pretty well. But to the horror of my director and me, I was dumbfounded when one of the cast members, in a hurry, tripped over the wire and knocked the little machine out of my hands resulting in a black-out on the TV. I stared in awe and disbelief thinking that I ruined the performance by the fatuous mistake. Trying to keep my temper low and the situation under control, I tried my best not to panic. So, to my director's relief, I unplugged the TV and then plugged it back in time for the next slide. Thinking that I was going to get bad remarks, I was quite surprised when my director patted me on the back said \"Good Job! You had it under control.\" Later I came to know that the audience never realized there was a crash backstage.","label":"human"}

I have decided to write about why I dont like the idea of extracurricular activities. I disagree with extracurricular activities students are tired at the end of the day, students might have somethings to do after school the teachers dont want to stay after school everyday. For example,students have seven to eight hours a day of school so they are going to be exhausted at the end of school. For instance,students might have had a test and they have to stay after school for an extracurricular activity. students would start to dislike school for making them stay after school for activities they dont want to do. For example, students dont want to stay in school for more than seven or eight hours a day, It's exhausting to have to stay in school for up to nine hours for activities you dont want to do. We should not have to take an extracurricular activity. For example, students might have chores to do around there home, not every student can stay after school everyday. For example, students might have a doctor's appointment after school and they cant stay after school and students have to get a note from there parents saying they have a doctor's appointment. For instance,Students might be on a sports team and they have to go to training or they have a game,what are they going to do then? Students should not have to take an after school activity. For example Teachers have longer hours than the students. Teachers get to school before the students, and leave school after the students and sometimes they even stay after school. Teachers are exhausted after school and the teachers choose to stay after school, they should not have to stay after school everyday. For instance,teachers are going to be cranky at the end of the day because there may be some kids who made the teacher angry or the teacher is just tired at the end of the day either way the teachers should not have to stay after school, only the ones who choose to stay after school should stay. For example,teachers choose to stay after school to grade students work and teacher choose a day or two to stay after school to help the students who need help and if they stayed after school everyday they would not want to stay after school to grade or to help the students with work. Teachers should not have to stay after school everyday. 'If students stayed after school everyday they would not have time to do what they like at home.'' I disagree with extracurricular activities and we should not have to take an extra activity after school because students are tired at the end of the day,students might have somethings to do after school,and teachers dont want to stay after school everyday. Students should not be forced to take an extracurricular activity because they have seven to eight hours of school a day, they might be on a sports team or have chores,and teachers dont want to stay after school everyday.","label":"human"}
{"id":176,"text":"During the summer break, it is important for students to engage in some educational activities that can keep their minds stimulated and promote their creativity. Traditionally, summer projects are designed and assigned by teachers, with the expectation that students will work on them and submit a report at the start of the new academic year. However, there are arguments in favor of giving students the chance to choose their own projects and work on them independently. In this essay, I will examine the pros and cons of both approaches, and argue that students should be given the freedom to design their own projects. Firstly, when summer projects are assigned by teachers, there is the advantage of ensuring that all students are expected to work on assignments that are at an appropriate level for their age and academic ability. Assigning projects enables teachers to ensure that all students are working on something educational and relevant. Moreover, teachers can offer guidance and support that helps students address potential challenges they might face in the course of their projects. However, some of the downsides of teachers designing summer projects are that such projects can be prescriptive, inflexible and unengaging, particularly for students who are more self-directed learners. Also, such projects lack true authenticity as they remain restricted to a specific template, risks for different students to engage themselves with with their personal interests, and may reduce their sense of ownership or commitment. Students may find more pleasure when pursuing topics or formats through methods they discovered not taught. Therefore, transitioning to student-led summerprojects empowers the students to devise creative and engaging academic orocial service projects exclusive to their intentional articulations. By giving students the opportunity to design their own summer projects, they feel genuinely interested and invest a high sense of purpose, furthermore, cementing an innovative ethic and curiosity that sustains academic discipline at later stages of students' journey. Taking these upshots into account, designing one's thought-provoking project pursuing one's interests results in intensifying the sense of ownership thereby guaranteeing greater scheme-administration liabilities increasing cognitive versatility. Another plus for self-ruled projects is the children can marvel at transcending traditional notions as their own innovative perspectives and applications aids reducing reliant on prepacked ready summar products.A degree of having to create practical applications on a subject that a student at stake learning thrives vision and inventiveness. In conclusion, making project goals adaptable to student interests along with serving academically resonating the fundaments proves suitable going by individualistic factors. Overto research orpersonal growth-oriented one student's projects in a distinct way explores transcend traditional notion, helps to gear-a clear self-disorganization thereby enables proving caliber ensuring training geared-ahead criteria, student's cognitive versatility assured. Offering students the power to decide what topics they are passionate about generates greater excitement observed zeal from them.thus I believe students should be given the power to choose their summer projects as it offers them flexibility and respect for individuality that prepares them better for","label":"ai"}

{"id":178,"text":"I know it's been a busy week with all the essays to edit, so thanks in advance. Here's mine: The great thing about magic is that it is always as much fun for the magician as it is for the audience. I love performing magic tricks for friends, family, and newly made acquaintances, because I can incessantly amuse and impress them with just a deck of cards or a coin. The most exciting part of a trick is learning how it works and how to execute it correctly. There is an \"aha\" moment for me when all the sleight of hand practice I have done and each of the false shuffles I learned to come together into the trick, and I think to myself, \"Wow. So that's how it works.\" I have a strikingly similar experience when I learn about science. When the magic of muscle movement in animals or the strange behavior of super fluids is explained by a teacher or textbook, my resulting amazement is more enthusiastic than it get even after figuring out the most complex card trick. The way the world works truly amazes me. In the same way that a magician uses familiar techniques to invent new tricks, I enjoy using inference to learn things for myself and tie ideas from different sciences together to reveal their connection in the real world. For example, after learning about an electron's probability waves and explaining it to the teacher supervising my quantum mechanics independent study, I was learning about photosynthesis and electron transport chains in AP Biology. When my teacher explained that chloroplasts may be the most energy efficient things in the world, I immediately made the connection that this was the case because the electrons were moving through the single most efficient pathways as a result of the way they travel as both particles and waves. My interest in figuring out the inner workings of the world leads me to take interest in the science of how things work. If information is not available, I do not give up looking for it, but rather make it available. When I wanted to learn about quantum mechanics, a subject not offered in Brookline High School, I took initiative by myself to find a teacher to supervise my study, set up a curriculum, assign projects, and to find a textbook for my class. I now meet with the head of my high school's science department every week and explain new aspects of quantum theories and applications to him. We do projects, run experiments, and attempt applied calculations for every phenomenon that interests us. Though I aspire to be a dentist, I plan to try to do microbiological research on the side, using either grants or a university research salary to furnish my lab with equipment and tools. I choose to apply for admission to the College of Arts and Sciences solely to be able to pursue a biology major and to have as many science courses open to me as possible.","label":"human"}
{"id":179,"text":"The recent discovery of what appears to be a face on the surface of a distant planet has sparked heated debate about whether its origins are natural or man-made. While some believe it is evidence of intelligent life, others counter that it is merely a trick of light and shadow. In my opinion, there is a strong probability that the mysterious face is a natural formation. First of all, we often mistake natural features on Earth, such as rock formations or clouds, for individual shapes or objects due to our pattern-seeking brains. This tendency may be magnified on an extraterrestrial planet, where we have less contextual information and a greater inclination to perceive meaning in ambiguous patterns. Therefore, it is possible that the face is actually a coincidental formation of geographic features. Furthermore, our understanding of the geography and geology of planets continues to grow as technological advances in exploration and imaging are made. The face may have simply been overlooked or misunderstood in earlier discoveries. Additionally, there is no evidence of a structured society on the planet or any advanced technology that would suggest intelligent life. Overall, although the idea of discovering evidence of alien life is certainly exciting, it is important that we consider all the evidence and interpret it rationally. Until stronger evidence emerges, it is most likely that the face on the distant planet is nothing more than an inanimate patch of rock.","label":"ai"}

However, there appears to be a complication in the electoral process that is being debated- the role of electors. Some voices call for regular citizens to have more control through adopting a popular vote system, while others defend the central role that electors play in the presidential election. In my view, I believe those opponents of electors are right to ask for the necessity of existence, and the process should instead favor a real measure of individual choice. In the electoral college system, electors are responsible for pledging support for one presidential candidate before the general election. In essence, these electors are responsible for ensuring fair representation on behalf of states involved by casting significance regional representation votes. However, some may debate limitations based on nature, there is no removal for electors who vote against historically democrat\/republican\/reality of a preset story-so disappointinglly- is continuous. Furthermore, during cases when tied in election results unavoidably lead up towards being undemocratic, it essentiallys puts select few favored electors, not citizens, in determining the outcome.

It can lead to increased stress levels for already overburdened students; families who lack transportation would find it exceptionally challenging to provide their child with this avenue, there may exist financial or other barriers, and forcing students into activities that they are not interested in could substantially impact their performance. I personally subscribe to the philosophy of letting the children 'lead the way,' allowing them to participate in whatever activities catch their fancy, to nurture their interests effectively. Encouraging students to zealously participate in activities they're passionate about comes more naturally for them, instead of being force-fed previously taken decissions based on someone different. From volunteering to work roles, there exists a range of alternative ways to show societal service or interest in this subject from classrooms for developing programmes that enable students to participate in domain activities that align with their individual interests outside the school's premise or partner with specific organizations, such as food banks, hospitals, libraries. In summary, despite the benefits endowed by most extracurricular activities' inclusivity for harnessing divergent formative or social skills amongst students. Still, in retrospect, focusing on shared objectives interests aligned with individual students would help establish extracurricular activities' effectiveness even more harmoniously. Therefore, cooperation with regional establishments, parent teacher organisations incorporated with an awareness of the resources readily available may encourage flexibility and willingness to pay it forward to get interested in a field outside of school precidgtariive. though an educational institution, outsourcing towards places like museums, businesses in ways that allow the student a freehand within boundaries is a way to foster a generation of creative self-taughts committed to steady growth outside of seated academia.","label":"ai"}

{"id":186,"text":"When it comes to making important decisions, seeking advice from one source is hardly sufficient, and often can result in a lack of confidence in one's chosen path. In order to make better decisions and gain confidence in one's choices, I firmly believe that seeking advice from multiple sources is imperative. Whether it be regarding personal challenges or professional goals, having the opinions and perspectives of different individuals with varying experiential backgrounds aids in considering a wide array of possibilities, gathering insight, reducing uncertainty, and ultimately obtaining reassurance in our decision-making process. Multiple sources of advice allow us to access an assortment of knowledge and enrichment, which, in turn, helps facilitate the decision-making process. It fosters brainstorming and creative discussions that explore various solutions to an issue. If an individual were to consult only one person, it limits the possibility of a compiled viewpoint. For example, consider a college student seeking advice from others career alternatives preceding a significant career in life. If they are attempting to solicit alternating disciplinary courses - accountancy, law, engineering - where they possess no grounding awareness, that area, he-she can rely on first-hand experiences shared by professionals spanning each department. Better still, aspiring couriers are provided with suitable means, deadlines, stipulated rules and ethics involved, etc., in explicitly comprehending what's fitting for them. Furthermore, utilizing multiple sources of advice indicates empiricism and belief in a decision through fortification and affirmation from all sides. Even when faced with a distressing crisis, following knowledge from authority in defined knowledge schemes beefs or bolsters the decision with supported acuteness. Subsequently, reliance on any type of guidance helps improve an individual's decision-making performance which, in the aftermath makes decision-making seem inexpensive and appealing.Lastly, Advice's significance to decision-making reflects as resilience, thanks to advice from a diverse trustworthy fund of advisors. If the scheme assesses practice maximally producing easy tasks comparable to real-world obstacles, casting doubt upon true worth isn't a variable anymore.

{"id":188,"text":"Competition is prevalent everywhere in our society. Despite causing many people to feel stressed or pressured, competition is beneficial for challenging oneself, but it must be utilized properly. A common habitat of competition is in sports. Whether it be competing against another person, another team, or against time, sports push people to work harder, faster, and stronger. This athletic competition is good, because it is mutually beneficial for both parties. Both and all players are challenged physically, and thats are taught both the importance and, if they succeed, the rewards of hard work. Competition in sports is expected, However, the misuse of competitiveness has become common in academics. While competition in sports is expected, academics is meant to be more reflective. Competition between students for the highest marks can be good, as both will challenge each other, but often makes other students feel belittled and unworthy. Grades in particular are a measure of self-knowledge and hard work and should not be used to compare one student to another. This is where and how competition is often misused and its intentions misunderstood. Often this misused competition comes from pressure from peers, parents, and sometimes teachers. A common example is competition between siblings stimulated by parents: comparing the childrens looks, academie abilities, athleticism, and social awareness. This kind of abusive competition is more likely to create anxiety, insecurity, and depression for both siblings, revealing perhaps the most important condition for healthy competition: it has to come from yourself. Almost all negative experiences with competition stem from society around us, leading many to believe that the correct thing to do is compare students, siblings. children, employees, and more. But competition's true purpose is to inspiles oneself to work hard and take on new challenges. \"Forced\" competition doesn't allow a person to be in control of their goals. This is why Kohn felt \"caught on a treadmill,\" when being compared to others. The competition comes from within and motivates one to set, work for, and reach new goals. To prevent unhealthy competition, people should try to be more vocal about their goals and expectations about themselves. Encouragement, of course, is always nice so voicing your wishes is important. If parents, teachers, or bosses know what you expect from yourself. they can better encourage, support, and challenge you.","label":"human"}

Not only did it help bring back memories from my childhood, I also learn the correctness of a quote: \"patience is a virtue\". Being with the children every day after school can be a little hard but through this experience I tested my patience. Going from calculus to kindergarten's math really made a hit to my patience. It's so easy to add and subtract for me, but it takes a great deal of time to explain it to a child who is barely five years old. Patience is truly a trait that shows high moral standards. Even though I still have many hardships to go through, I'm sure that with the practice of patience, I'll be able to overcome them all. Every time I think of my grandmother I feel like I could have expressed my love toward her more but now, unfortunately, it is too late. October 2008 was the worst month for me. It was one of the darkest moments of my life. Not only did I lose a grandmother that day, I also lost a part of me. When my mom called from Hong Kong to tell me about the news I couldn't believe it. My strong, amicable grandmother had passed away, and thankfully it was a no-pain death. In 1993, my parents decided to immigrate to Puerto Rico for a better life, and I, only being one year old, was left with my grandmother and aunt. I wouldn't ask for anyone else to raise me because these two women were there for me all the time. They both were moms to me. My grandmother, only 47 years old at that time, hadn't retired yet. Needing to work, she had to leave me with a babysitter, but she made sure that I was well taken care of. On weekends, she, along with my aunt, would take me to theme parks, beach, camping etc. When I was three years old, my mom decided for me to go to Puerto Rico to stay with her. My grandmother, together with my grandfather and aunt, came with me to check out the place and see if it was any good for me. After three weeks my grandmother, my grandfather and my aunt had to leave. I was left with my parents. Although I can't remember it well, my parents told me that I would cry day and night asking for my grandmother, asking where she was and why she had to be so cruel and leave me here. My mom was heartbroken. I wouldn't pay attention to anything she said. When my grandmother called, I would be screaming my head off for her to come back and get me. I was so sad that I lose ten pounds in only one month. My grandmother, hearing this news, would tell me that if I behaved then she would come visit me soon. Being the eager child that I was I hung onto every word she said; I started eating again, went to nursery school and behaved like a perfect child would. After two years, when I was five, I was enchanted to see my grandmother's pumped up, unwrinkled face. She, who barely topped five feet, picked me up and showered me with her loving kisses. That moment was one of my happiest childhood memories. When I think about her, the first thing that comes to my mind is her cooking. There is no one in this whole wide world who cooks better than she in my opinion. Her love for food makes what she cooks tastier. She would spend around 3 hours daily preparing supper for us. No matter what she cooked, from seafood to just plain salad, it tasted as if it came from a five-star restaurant to me. One of her uniqueness was her love for music. She got her own iPod, which she listened to when she is walking in the park as a form of exercise. She would want the newest songs along with oldies that she liked. My grandmother would even ask me to teach her how to use the computer for her to download her own music. I've done many things in my life that I regret. The one thing that I regret the most was when she had to return to Hong Kong to treat cancer I didn't want to talk to her. I was afraid, I was afraid that I would break down while talking to her, I wanted her to know that I was strong, but I really wasn't. I wanted her to be strong, I didn't want her to be discouraged, but now I regret it deeply. Furthermore, I should have talked to her because then I could express my love but I, stupid me, was afraid, afraid that I would lose her... Furthermore, I couldn't have asked for a greater grandmother because she, who is in my heart forever, was the best. Furthermore, I will always remember her lovely, amicable face. She, who would cook me whatever I wanted to eat, who woke up every morning to prepare my breakfast and my lunch of the day, and who would express her everlasting love for me constantly. She is the person who made me who I am today. I'll never forget about her. No matter where she is, I know that she is looking out for me, blessing me every moment with her love.

Since she also enjoyed camping, she decided to go deep into the forest during a long weekend to complete her assignment. As she got deeper into the forest, away from civilization, the tree cover became thicker, and therefore the floor of the forest became darker. \"Perfect for fungi growth!\" she thought. She started seeing more and more fungi, some on the trees, some on rotting logs, and some on the forest floor. Peculiarly, most of the fungi she began to see as she got deeper in the forest were green, which was quite unusual. She catalogued all the fungi she saw for the next several days. On her way out, she took the same path she came in on, but noticed that the fungi along her path had changed to possess typical colors of fungi, not the green she had seen when she came in. She explored perpendicular to her path, and found a slowly changing range of colors, until she saw the same green she had seen when she came in. She needed to return to school, but decided to come back the next weekend. When she arrived back into the fungi's domain, she saw something breathtaking as she explored. Everywhere she had gone, a ripple of colors seemed to have formed. The fungi had reacted to her presence, and sent signals to the other fungi in the area, where the signal had been propagated. Some of the fungi on her original path had even returned to the original green color she had observed upon entering the forest. She also noticed the local fauna completely avoided the areas where the fungi had changed from its original green color.

It is not always the obstacle that we have been faced with that defines us, but rather how we overcome it and what we become from it as a result. This is what makes us distinctive and unique.

Before my extensive college marathon began, I thought there was only one barrier - an academic one, consisting of standardized tests and rigorous coursework - standing as an obstacle between me and going to college. Unfortunately, I was wrong, because there was definitely another hurdle. The second one doesn't require any scholarly attributes at all to leap over, just the money in my family's pocket. In April, my dad had lost his job due to the collapsing economy. This was around the time when students were to begin notifying schools about their intention to enroll or not for the coming fall. Given my father's situation, I was faced with the inevitable realization that I won't be able to begin college this fall, and I that had to take a gap year. Nevertheless, I didn't allow what I missed out on affect the opportunities I did have at my disposal. Determined not to waste my year off, I decided to use this time to pursue all the activities my high school schedule would not permit. In high school, French was one of my favorite subjects however I had to drop it because it clashed with two of my other classes. So now that I have the time, I have enrolled in an intermediate French program hosted by the French Embassy, where my interest in the French can grow. This 4-month class has been truly enriching because as I was learning French, French was teaching me life lessons and the importance of self-motivation, listening, humility, humor, responsibility and passion. Through French, I have become a completely independent student, which has enabled me to teach myself and retain information whenever I came across something undiscovered. I was and still am in my own world of this language, which is especially beneficial for learning any subject. Subsequently, I am now fervently interested in pursing a double major in French and Biochemistry, something that I would not have done if I had not been on my gap year. Moreover, as a responsible and self-motivated student, I wish to take an active role in my medical education and learn for my future to become the best Internist I can be. My high school science education has done an excellent job of equipping me with the knowledge I need to begin pursuing my goal. Thus, through the six-month Congestive Heart Failure Volunteer Program at New York Methodist Hospital, I hope to bridge theory and practice as I apply my knowledge and skills in a clinical setting. As a volunteer I will work alongside physicians to enhance patients' understanding of chronic heart failure and to teach them practical techniques and skills to help manage their disease. Again, this is an opportunity that I feel would not have been available if not for my gap year. The reason for my gap year is less than ideal, but I have learned about resilience and about being steadfast in the face of adversity. I know these qualities will help me excel in college as they have helped me arise triumphantly in my turbulent years. Thank you in advance for your help!","label":"human"}
{"id":193,"text":"The Electoral College is a fundamental part of the U.S. political system. However, many people debate the practice's advantages and disadvantages. Some assert that the Electoral College guarantees an equal portrayal for smaller states, while others claim that it's an antiquated system that doesn't mirror democracy's principles. Given the problems with the Electoral College, there has been much discussion about whether the United States should drop the system and use a direct vote instead. Yet, despite its flaws, the Electoral College system should not be dismantled. The supporters of the electoral college believe that it balances the influence of smaller states. Preventing dominance by large states is critical, particularly in choosing the head of the world's most powerful country. Furthermore, the voting structure serves as a safeguard against fraudulent activities. On the other hand, distrust of the outcome has always undermined this structure's trustworthiness. The use of a direct national election instead of the Electoral College's process may seem appealing regarding accepting the well-known one-person-one-vote mandate up voted by democratic popular functioning in previous elections, promotion of admission capability turning toward freedom of speech with general ideological inclines at the grassroots level developments united for all coalition organized towards maturity ideologically devoid of prejudices and finally equalness of election through equality of citizens' suffrage. It is not without its faults The largest population-favored locations dictate only voice concerns while those that don't politically silent, less populous states accounted other excuses, redundant popularity contests, the possibility for widespread fraud discarding dissimilar relevant","label":"ai"}

Vermeer was a Dutch painter from the 1600s and he was known for his realistic paintings of everyday life. We saw a lot of his paintings and they were really impressive, especially when you consider the time period they were from. My favorite painting was definitely the Girl with a Pearl Earring. The colors and lighting were amazing, and it was kind of mesmerizing to look at. We also saw some other paintings from different artists, like Rembrandt and Frans Hals, and they were all really cool too. It was a nice break from all the usual teenage stuff and I actually learned something new.","label":"human"}
{"id":195,"text":". Working with a business entrepreneur is fascinating, be detail-orientated is the prior skills to acquire, to think of the outcome and be creative during work is important as well. Dealing with various personalities has always been a good training for me to be sociable. I have experience working in a Japanese Restaurant where I learn a diversity of culture from the workers and customers there. They share their country and their experience with me which allows me to see the world in the simplest way. In the near future, I could see myself working on environmental work that included renewable resources and green process. Our world is now badly polluted, many efforts of saving the environment are enforced now, but it will be not enough to compensate to the harm we have done. Fruit yields had been badly affected by the unpredictable weather few years back due to pollutions. My father, who is a fruit planter and also the breadwinner in my family, struggled through that period of time, so our family did go through a hard time. This has leads me to read on the achievements made for a better future by professionals around the world. I hope to be a part of the workforce to make more difference to the world.","label":"human"}

{"id":197,"text":"The way the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite is by, giving facts about the good and bad thingds venus has The author talks about NASA'S possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus. He also gives examples like, Imagining a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling venusian landscape. just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms. The author support's the idea by saying,\" Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors contribute to venus\"s reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us \". Also the author talk's about venius having no value. The author say's that Venus has no value because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. The author talks about the NASA working on other approaches to studyng venus. Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus's surface and have lasted for three weels in such conditions. Another thing that the author is also talking about is another project, looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. These devicers were fisrt envisioned in the 1800s and plaed an important role in the 1940s during world war II. I Venus at thirty - plus miles above the surface, tempetures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on the earth. solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exeed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.","label":"human"}
{"id":198,"text":"Decision-making is an essential part of our daily lives, whether it is related to a personal or professional sphere. Choosing a path can be intimidating if one lacks knowledge or perspective. This is where seeking multiple opinions can come in handy. There are several benefits of seeking second opinions when confronted with a challenging issue. Firstly, it opens up different perspectives, helping one gain an understanding of the problem from various angles. Recently, I was faced with a profound dilemma over the selection of my university degree. I asked for advice and opinion from my mentors, seniors, and counselors. This exercise provided me with different perspectives that proved helpful in making a wise choice. Secondly, seeking numerous opinions can confirm one's biases or challenge them; often one thinks one thing, and it differs from the majority of the opinions in a certain matter. Consulting several people can rectify the decision-making process by expanding knowledge and perspective instead of relying solely on one's views. A scenario of buying a house can be an example, someone considering and researching the purchase can harness different homeowner's opinions of the neighborhood and for citing vicinities. And lastly, approaching multiple people shades a more coherent way advocating their problems. Seeking advice reduces the chance of making hasty, uninformed decisions that can have everlasting issues, ultimately improving the quality and successful output. Several experts concur and explain how diverse hearsays help people process through all possible future outcomes, which is comparatively important whilst dealing with significant issues. In conclusion, in situations where choices affect personal or professional attitudes, carrying multiple Opinions invariably guarantees maximal error reduction and rectified time utilization. It promotes impression increasing methods where the individuals' conclusions involve actively incorporating the arguments of others until an equally controversial position constitutes itself.","label":"ai"}
