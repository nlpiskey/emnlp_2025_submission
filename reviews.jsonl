{"id":2,"text":"I had the unfortunate experience of visiting this establishment for the second time in the last three years, and I must say, it was an absolute nightmare. The first time I visited was after the Great Taste of the Midwest, and it seemed like the perfect spot to unwind and relax. However, the waitstaff and bouncers were shockingly rude, and the manager was nowhere to be found. The experience was so horrendous that I made a conscious decision to avoid this place entirely during last year's festival. Against my better judgment, I decided to give it another shot this year, hoping that they had improved. Unfortunately, it seems that their growth in size has not translated into better service or customer care. We were made to wait for over an hour, despite there being more than enough space available for our party of seven, including two children. The hostess for the biergarten, who appeared to be no older than 22, was condescending and utterly unhelpful. Her behavior was a disgrace to her supposed education at UW, if she was indeed attending there. She half-heartedly offered to fetch her manager, but predictably, they never bothered to grace us with their presence. To add insult to injury, our waitress took a whopping 15 minutes to even acknowledge our presence at the table. And when she finally did, she had the audacity to refuse our request for a round of beers, belittling us in the most condescending manner possible. Apparently, this self-proclaimed expert in binge drinking deemed it necessary for us to consume water first. Little did she know, our frustration and hunger were the only things driving our heightened emotions, not an uncontrollable desire for alcohol. In the end, we decided to cut our losses and leave, leaving me unable to express my anger by leaving a meager tip. Let me be clear, Great Dane: your beer is far from great. I would rate it a measly three out of ten. I cannot recall a single person ever expressing enthusiasm for your food either. And now, after enduring two dreadful experiences, it is abundantly clear that your service is abysmal. The only thing you have going for you is your convenient location for the beer festival. We ended up salvaging the rest of our night by seeking refuge at your competitor, the Old Fashioned. I implore anyone reading this to not be fooled by this bar's favorable location and to avoid it at all costs. I, for one, will never subject myself to such disrespect again.","label":"ai"}
{"id":3,"text":"Visited Monta Ramen on my last Vegas trip. I've been wanting to go since I moved from here 3 years back. The size of the place often leads to long queues which I don't like. But this time, we hit a sweet spot and there was no line. My order included Small Fried Rice for $3.95 and two types of Ramen; Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen and Miso Ramen without meat, both for $7.25 each. One thing to note is the servings here are smaller compared to other places. If you're used to big bowls of Ramen, you might find these a bit small. However, the fried rice was really tasty and the Ramen was packed with flavor. I especially loved the Miso Ramen and my partner enjoyed the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen. They prepare the Ramen fresh, so be ready to wait a bit. We sat at the counter and watched them prepare our meals, which was quite interesting. As for the hype, Monta Ramen met my expectations. I would rate it 4 stars. Chances of me returning? 80%.","label":"ai"}

It used to be, but not anymore. I steer clear of this place like the plague. If you're into blasting frat party tunes from 2007, then this joint is your jam.

The beef was definitely fresh and sliced by them or wherever they bought it because it was not your normal typical beef that you get at other places. My husband enjoyed the egg rolls more here but I didn't notice a huge difference except there was no lettuce to wrap the egg rolls with. Not sure if they forgot or if that's not their type but in any case it was decent. The broth wasn't bad either, not the best I've had but it works. There wasn't too much broth but it worked out since its so hot I didn't gulp down the broth anyways. There's only one size and I think its about 8 bucks a bowl give or take which is about the same as other places? Noodles are a lil less too but I was full regardless. \\n\\nNot sure how long they are giving away the 20% discount for but it's definitely a decent pho joint.

Fast forward to last year and I had never eaten at Chipotle again thinking \\\"gross\\\"...the more is more concept of globbing tons of food into a burrito that was not dispersed properly and had dried out beans and chicken and charged extra for chips and salsa. Never ate at a Chipotle again. Then a year or so ago, I had a weekly meeting and always needed dinner and the only place on the road to my meeting was a Chipotle, so I had NO CHOICE but to eat there. Well, it was delicious! So delicious in fact that I ate there 4 weeks in a row and couldn't wait to get there. \\n\\nSo I finally go back to my Chipotle in my neighborhood and think I have been missing out all these years.

Yes, Joe, this one goes out to your pretentious ass.\\n\\nI went to XS for Tiesto night with three other girls after being promised by two different legit hosts that we would be able to get in on the reduced admission guest list ($20 for girls, $50 for guys). We were in line by 10 pm and did everything as we were told. When we got to the front of the line, however, Joe stopped us and told us there was no such thing as a reduced admission guest list. My friend and I whipped out our cell phones to show him the text messages we'd received literally minutes ago from our promoters, who were both working at Tryst that night. Joe basically told us he thought we were bullshitting (even though we told him he could check the numbers) and said he was only doing his job and we would have to pay $100 to get in (after telling our other friends $75 about 20 minutes earlier). Um... I'm sorry? I understand it's Tiesto night, but it's not even 11 pm, we're four girls on the guest list, and you're telling us to pay $100 to get into your club? We pointed out the absurdity of this and Joe told us in the rudest, most sarcastic tone ever that the only way he would accept proof of the \\\"reduced admission guest list\\\" we claimed existed was if we dragged one of our promoters over from Tryst to walk us in. We asked, very patiently, if we could go over and get a video recording or signature or something as proof. He said no and refused to offer a reason why, instead telling us over and over again to step out of line. \\n\\nBy this point we were tired of wasting time when he was just being an asshole for the sake of being an asshole so we finally complied, but instead of leaving we went to go talk to Eric, who wrote us a slip within 10 seconds of us showing him our texts. After we got in my friend went to go give Joe a piece of her mind, and he conveniently slammed the door in her face.\\n\\nFYI, Joe, just because you're having a miserable night doesn't mean you have to ruin ours.","label":"human"}

They are generous with the amount of ingredients in the crepe and you can specify as many types as you wish. Think subway. We had a savory crepe and also tried a waffle sandwich.

{"id":32,"text":"Friday night was the first night of service, and me and the missus happened to cruise by and saw the window was chock-full of folks waitin' for a table. After what felt like an eternity of delays, the sister joint to the legendary Point Brugge Cafe (Point Breeze) finally swung open its doors. Official grand opening's set for Tuesday 1 February, but they hollered at the Highland Park locals for a \"soft opening\" a bit earlier in the week. If you've peeped the rave reviews of Point Brugge Cafe, you'll know that Pittsburgh just got blessed with another top-notch fresh-food spot! Another notch on the belt for Bryant Street and Highland Park's restaurant scene. The place's got a modern vibe -- clean and straightforward -- but cozy as can be. It's a lively joint (some might say \"loud\") so if you're lookin' for a low-lit, quiet, lovey-dovey dinner, this ain't your spot. But if you're after top-tier grub in a buzzing setting, you might just have found your new chow-down spot. I wish I could gab more about the menu, but me and the wifey both went for the same dishes. We kicked off with a potato\/pancetta soup. It was broth-based with a splash of cream to hold it together. Light and scrumptious. For the main course: herb-crusted salmon atop a bed of arugula and lentils. Despite us ordering the salmon well-done (not too keen on raw fish, see), the salmon was moist and packed with flavor. The arugula and lentils were fantastic. For dessert, we split an order of profiteroles: three crispy, hollow pastries filled with ice cream and drizzled in chocolate and, I reckon, a smidgen of caramel. Super tasty. I'm not one for chocolate, but whatever they drizzled on those profiteroles was bang on. For the Point Brugge diehards, the menu includes the steamed P.E.I. mussels and Belgian-style twice-cooked fries with seasoned mayo. (The family at the table next to us polished off two orders of EACH!) The service was top-notch, even on their first night with customers. Heard they hired seasoned servers, host staff, and bartenders. Hats off to them for that. To sum it up: another stellar addition to the Pittsburgh restaurant scene and a real treat for those of us in the East End who love fresh, quality food. Only letdown was I couldn't get an espresso after dinner. Just regular American joe (though it IS PrestoGeorge coffee). No biggie, though, I can always mosey on over to Tazza d'Oro on Highland Avenue. Didn't grab the phone number or find a website for the place.

{"id":34,"text":"I had high hopes when I first visited this establishment in January 2011 based on a friend's recommendation, but I left feeling disappointed and dissatisfied. The price point is not for the faint of heart, with a bill totaling around $400 for a party of three. I was willing to overlook the high cost if the quality and value matched the price, but unfortunately, it fell short. I opted for the Surf and Turf at $65, hoping for a memorable dining experience. However, it was far from impressive. While the lobster was decent, the steak left much to be desired. It was neither great nor terrible, just okay. For the amount I paid, \"just okay\" was not what I was expecting. Upon expressing my disappointment to the friend who recommended the place, I was advised that I should have ordered the Wagyu beef or filet instead. Taking their advice, I returned with a group of 12 people and decided to give it another chance. The waiter highly recommended the chef's special, which required at least two people to order. I inquired about the difference between the beef in the Surf and Turf and the special, and was told that the special was a higher grade. We ordered the special, and received three different cuts of Wagyu beef. Despite requesting medium rare, all three cuts arrived at a medium doneness. Comparing our cuts to those who had ordered the standalone filet, we found that theirs was cooked to perfection. We brought this to the attention of the waiter, who kindly had the kitchen prepare new cuts. When they arrived, they were cooked as requested and were tender, but the overall experience had already been tainted. The richness of the meal, combined with the excessive amount of oil in the serving dish, made it difficult for any of us to finish our beef. The sides of asparagus, mushroom risotto, and baby spinach only added to the overwhelming nature of the meal. Despite the attentive service from the waiter, the hefty price tag of $175 for my meal left me feeling unsatisfied. The overall experience was just barely okay, and I cannot justify spending that amount of money for a mediocre dining experience. I have no plans to return to this establishment, as there are plenty of other options in the area that offer better value for the money.","label":"ai"}

{"id":36,"text":"First off, I do have to admit that I am somewhat of a sushi-snob. I went here once... and have not gone back. The food was okay for a Korean owned sushi place, however, what turned me off about this place the most was the customer service. The sushi chef my boyfriend and I had ignored us half the time and when I asked for ooba (japanese mint) to be placed in one of my rolls he said that it would be an extra charge. That's fine and all, I really don't mind that, but when one of my friends who is Korean told me that he went to this place and they didn't charge him for extras it really got me upset. I think consistency is a key component when building a clientele base and this restaurant is definitely not adhering to that policy with their sloppy rolls, heavy rice, and selective customer service. For the price and quality of fish, it is definitely not worth the 5 minute drive up Warm Springs. I would opt for Sushi-Mon (in Silverado Ranch, not Sahara) where the chefs are friendly, the fish is good, and the portion of rice is small (even for all you can eat).","label":"human"}

And asked the guy if they were fresh. He replies that he didnt know but that they were foil wrapped and are always fresh. so i asked him if i could squeeze it. He doesn't let me touch the box =( says it ruins the product. It was weird but w\/e i bought it. They were crunch.. dick.","label":"human"}
{"id":41,"text":"I recently had the best time at this establishment, and I can't wait to tell you all about it. Have you ever been to a party where only a few people showed up, but it ended up being the best party ever? That's exactly what I experienced at this place. I visited on a Sunday for lunch, and to my surprise, the place wasn't crowded at all. The high ceilings of the beer hall made it seem emptier than it actually was, but there were probably around 25 people there. The live entertainment was a guy in lederhosen who did an amazing job of keeping the energy high. He played music, did beer tricks, and even played a super long horn. After his performance, he went from table to table, chatting with guests and sharing a swig or two of beer. It was a unique and enjoyable experience. If you're up for it, you can participate in some fun activities and earn free goodies or beer. From doing the chicken dance to guessing the right number, there are opportunities to have a great time and win some prizes. As for the food, the portions are generous, and you can get a meat, potatoes, and sauerkraut meal for around $20. If you're not a fan of pork or sausage, there are other options like steak on the menu. In terms of pricing, the beer may seem a bit expensive, but once you've had a couple of drinks, getting another liter seems perfectly reasonable. My bill for four people, including a cheese plate, three entrees, a dessert, and 3 liters of beer, came to around $180 with tip. It's a bit pricey, but for the experience, it was worth it. While some might consider this place to be touristy, I found it to be a great spot for entertaining guests. I brought my cousin from Japan, and we had a fantastic time. Although I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here regularly, I think it's a fun place to visit occasionally. The giant beer hall room is the main area, while the beer garden room is for events or busier nights. Despite being labeled as air-conditioned, the beer garden room was a bit warmer, possibly due to the air not being on. Overall, I had an amazing time at this establishment and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a unique and entertaining experience. Just make sure you're well-funded and don't expect an authentic Bavarian experience. Also, consider visiting the nearby Hard Rock Casino for some additional entertainment.","label":"ai"}

{"id":45,"text":"I recently had the pleasure of dining at this establishment for both breakfast and dinner, and let me tell you, I was in food heaven! The breakfast buffet offered an incredible selection that catered to every taste and craving. I couldn't resist going back for seconds and even thirds, and the dessert section was a dream come true. The variety of options, including candied apples and sugar-free treats, left my inner foodie feeling completely satisfied. During dinner, I was impressed by the convenience of having the snow crab legs pre-cut, making it so easy to indulge in this seafood delicacy. The menu also featured unique items like octopus ceviche and rabbit pasta, and I indulged in a variety of lamb dishes that were simply divine. Despite the amazing food, the prices were reasonable, especially during the week, and I appreciated the opportunity to use coupons to save even more. Overall, my experience at this establishment was nothing short of fantastic. The abundance of delicious food, the convenience of pre-cut crab legs, and the reasonable prices make this buffet a must-visit. Whether you're a food enthusiast or just looking for a satisfying meal, I highly recommend checking it out. And as a bonus tip, don't forget to wear your stretchy pants to fully enjoy the feast!","label":"ai"}

And don't even get me started on the finance guy - what a jerk! And the lady at the desk? Yeah, not so nice. My mini is nice and all, but dealing with this dealership is not worth the trouble. If I could go back, I'd keep my old car for sure. Avoid this place at all costs.","label":"ai"}
{"id":47,"text":"Who knew Mexican food could be so deceptively challenging to master? The magic lies in the simple ingredients - rice, beans, tortilla shells - and yet, so many establishments manage to make these taste uninspiring. But not Los Cabos, they have truly cracked the code. I tried their Pittsburgh version of the California burrito and my friend opted for the fish tacos. The burrito was loaded with a generous helping of carne asada and fries, and while the guac and salsa were subtly present, the real star was the tortilla shell. It was grilled to perfection, adding a delightful crunch that elevated the whole meal. The fish tacos, too, were a treat. While the flavors were on the mild side, it allowed for the freshness of the fish to shine through. My friend decided to add a dash of Tapatio, chopped up the taco and mixed it with the side of rice and beans; an innovative approach that turned out quite delicious. The corn chips served on the side were also noteworthy. Crunchy and flavorful, they were perfect with a dash of Tapatio to spice things up. No matter how late it gets or how many drinks you've had, Los Cabos is a must-stop!","label":"ai"}

The prices are definitely on the higher side, but the quality of the food and the impeccable service made it worth every penny. I can't believe that someone had a bad experience here, but I guess you can't please everyone. I highly recommend American Fish to anyone looking for a top-notch dining experience in Las Vegas. Don't let a few negative reviews steer you away from what could be an amazing meal. Give it a try and see for yourself!","label":"ai"}
{"id":50,"text":"Ok, so Pinkberry infiltrating the Charlotte FroYo scene wasn't my greatest hope and dream, but the Arboretum location has turned me into a believer. Walk into the IKEA-laden shop and feast your eyes upon some of the most audacious flavors known to the Yogurt. The staff always assists newbies and hands out samples like its a festival. My adivce: If you've never been to Pinkberry or you are trying froyo for the first time, sample all of them. There is always a good range of regular flavors and a few adventurous choices. \\n\\nThe staff always remembers us and knows that we get two minis. Thanks for the recognition! We may as well start a Pinkberry clubhouse nearby. \\n\\nToppings: The fruit is cut a little too large for my liking, but suffice is to say that it is fresh and not out of a gross can or frozen. All together now: \\\"Dark Chocolate Crisps are the best thing since sliced bread.\\\" Aaaand there was much rejoicing throughout the land. These are the best topping for....any of the yogurts. I don't even care if it's mango, these little guys are your best friend. Perfect amount of crunch and chocolate flavor.

Each hummus was tasty and flavorful. They were sort of skimping on the pita bread, but did not hesitate to bring us more when we asked. I ordered the falafel gyro, and it was good, but not great. I've definitely had better- even at the chain Pita Jungle. My dad ordered the Moussaka, and he thought it was delicious. Maybe if I come back, I will order that instead? My favorite part of the meal, as ridiculous as it sounds, was the massive water glasses. I guess I consume a lot of water with my meals, and always feel like I have to bug the servers to bring me more. Well that's definitely not an issue here! Overall, A-OK pretty much sums it up.","label":"human"}

I was like okay this is different...it should work. It would have worked...if the pancakes weren't as dry as cardboard. I felt like I was eating a carrot cake flavored notebook! I like syrup since it soaks in and helps in the event that you jack up and overcook the cakes. The icing just sat on top and did nothing. It was rough. I'm not saying this place is bad. I would give it another chance when I'm in town. Maybe they just had an off day (with my plate). With so many choices in pancakes, I would try it again.

{"id":60,"text":"Wow.... where do I start? \\nWell about a week ago I ordered a burger and a side, I received the wrong burger and the wrong side, but I had already rode my bike home. So I called the manager on duty, lets call him \\\"T\\\". He was SUPER kind and wrote me down for a comp the next time I came in which was tonight. \\nI came all the way from phoenix but wanted to claim my free meal on the way home so I stopped in. It took them 15 MIN to bring out my comp order, but it was wrong again because they didn't read the order back to me to verify (and they never have). So I told the carhop and it took another ten minutes to get the correct burger out to me. By this time, my side item was cold. I had every intention of tipping the carhop even though I was claiming a free order. But she was so distant and lacked people skills and didn't remember the things I requested and didn't look me in the eyes, plus my order was wrong a third time. By the time I rode home, my food was cold (I even had it in a warm environment for the whole journey) and there was little to no condiments on my burger! Who wants a dry burger? Not this guy.\\nAll I can say, is the night manager on duty every time I go there looks like a punk (hood always covering his face, and I sound old for saying that, but I'm a 25 year old punk rocker myself, haha) and the kitchen seems to be stoned because I witnessed 3 inaccurate orders while I was trying to claim mine. \\nMy main complaint is that I worked at Sonic for over 2 years, and this kind of behavior at my locations would've gotten me fired. I've returned to the restaurant business since then and my philosophy is STILL to treat the customer how you would like to be treated. What's so hard about that?! Yeah, it's fast food. Yeah, they get paid minimum wage. But if you cant even follow your recipes, common sense, and core values, you don't deserve to have the job. There's many people out of work who would kill to have a job, even at Sonic.\\nIt's sad because this location is RIGHT by my house and it's good for a quick, cheap meal, but I will not be returning. This is absolutely the WORST Sonic experience I've ever had and it's the worst Sonic I've been to. What a shame, too, because it's in such a nice area. Maybe it's just the night crew since that's the time I usually visit, but all I know is this location needs a revamping of values and employees.","label":"human"}
{"id":61,"text":"It was okay. The server at the counter was more concerned with the call-in orders, which I guess is more common at this location due to the small amount of tables, but disappointing.

{"id":62,"text":"I recently stopped by this establishment after a volleyball game and despite a few hiccups, I had a decent experience. The girls working that day seemed a bit indifferent and the service was not up to par. However, the food I ordered, a hot roast beef sandwich with chips and a soda, was delicious. When I inquired about the location of the chips, one of the girls responded in a somewhat smug manner, which was a bit off-putting. Additionally, I encountered a small issue when I wanted to grab a soda and wash my hands. I placed my number by the register and was abruptly told to carry it with me. Although this interaction was a bit odd, the staff in the kitchen was friendly and attentive. While no one checked on me or offered any additional items during my meal, I still enjoyed my food, finished my soda, and cleaned up after myself. Despite the mixed experience, I might consider giving this place another chance in the future.","label":"ai"}

The chicken wings were delicious also. My burger was tasty although nothing special. And the fries I got were very generic, like they came out of the freezer.

There is no layer of the cutting and it is not horizontally on the same level. I think he is not serious about what he did. I will not come for the second time. MCN is much better in this sense.

Hop in the taxi line right outside and head to your hotel! Easy, cheap and way fast. They must have at least 50 brands of every kind of liquor too, so they will definitely have what you want.

Additionally, although The Orleans boasts several dining options, my favorite, Fuddruckers, was a letdown. Despite my initial excitement, their veggie burger turned out to be disappointing.

{"id":80,"text":"Let me preface this review with a bit of context. I made a call to the establishment earlier in the week to inquire about their reservation policy because we had an 8-person party. I was told by the hostess that for a party \"our size\" I needed to speak to their event coordinator, as they weren't equipped to handle large groups and didn't take reservations. I left a message and called again two days later when I didn't receive a response. The event coordinator finally got back to me with a voicemail that I found quite rude. She stated that they only had a single area by the bar to accommodate an 8-person party and their banquet room was fully booked. She also mentioned an expected wait time of about an hour for our group size. From the start, it felt like having an 8-person party was a major inconvenience. I called back to speak with a manager, hoping to establish some sort of understanding for our large party, but the female manager was not helpful and came off as rather snooty. She simply reiterated that they weren't set up for large parties. I wasn't impressed at all. To summarize, we were seated immediately upon arrival. Our waitress was fairly pleasant. The interior was spacious and well-decorated, although it lacked a personal touch and felt more like a chain restaurant. We ordered the guacamole and fried green tomato appetizers, but they were rather tasteless and the portions were disappointingly small. The main courses, which included everything from ribs to salads and burgers, were just satisfactory. One person in our party didn't receive his meal until everyone else had finished due to a mistake by the waitress. While mistakes happen, there was no apology from the management and it was barely acknowledged by the waitress. She did offer a free dessert as compensation, which was appreciated. The dessert options we tried - banana cream pie, key lime pie, and apple crisp - were mediocre at best. The banana cream pie was unimpressive, the key lime pie was overly tart, and the apple crisp was the only one we enjoyed. In conclusion, the food was average, and the service was nothing special. Considering the pricing, there are better places to dine. I have no intention of returning.","label":"ai"}

The 30 shooting lanes are great, and there is even an exclusive VIP section for Titanium Club members.

As a member, you can make lane reservations 24 hours in advance, which is highly recommended. Non-members might experience long waits for a lane on busy weekends and evenings, as members are given priority. The gun store section offers a decent selection of guns and ammo, ranging from sub-compact pistols to large caliber rifles. They also have a good variety of accessories. However, the prices are on the higher side, so unless you really need something, it's better to shop online at Gunbroker and use the FFL at the gun club to receive your purchase. There is a $20 fee per gun for this service. The employees at the gun range are generally knowledgeable and friendly, although there are a few who may not approach you unless you flag them down. But overall, they are cool and helpful. For those looking to avoid crowds, I recommend visiting on a Sunday or mid-week, one hour before closing.

The owner's laid-back attitude and commitment to quality food make it feel like you're dining in his home. A true inspiration, he even bikes from his home to work. A must-visit for a unique and relaxing dining experience. #yum","label":"ai"}

{"id":91,"text":"Slidin thru is one of the \\\"staple\\\" food trucks in Vegas that I feel everyone should go to at least once. I've been a loyal fan of them for forever. I also love that they have a brick and mortar store. My only regret is that I don't live closer to them anymore. \\nOne of the major things you'll like at slidin thru is the vibe and environment. The music is always nice, and usually something you don't expect to hear at a burger joint. It's spacious and well designed. The aesthetics work well together and it's a very pleasant environment to be in. \\nThe sliders are all pretty good. There's a vegetarian one that I've never tried because I'm team carnivore all the way. My favorite are the porky which is a pulled pork and jalape\\u00f1o and the buffalo soldier which is a buffalo chicken inspired bit. They also have mystery sliders and random daily sliders that come and go so its always worth a shot to check that. \\nThe fries in my personal opinion are meh. I've never had em where I like em there's always been something wrong with them so I never even really eat them anymore. \\nAnother great experience is with the workers. They are always super friendly, super nice and give you a fist bump when you get your order. Another random aside is that the hats that the workers wear are awesome. It's a black\/red\/yellow SnapBack with their logo. It's ridiculously awesome and they sold it at the store for awhile. I've actually bought like 4 of them but because everyone loves it and always steals them from me because they just have to have it. Maybe I should just get a punch card with the hats. After the 4th hat your 5th is free lmao. \\nBut overall this is a stellar place. Food is good, vibe is good. If you ever aren't on the north side you can go to the food truck. They're usually at first Friday and strEATS and I know they do private events. They were supposed to open a second location down on trop and ft. apache but that has never come to fruition:(","label":"human"}

I recently went to this bar and got a Guinness that was on special and I tasted it and almost spit it out, it tasted like straight gasoline! I told the bartender about it and she proceeded to argue with me that I didn't know what I was talking about. I couldn't finish the beer. Guinness for the record is my favorite beer. She proceeded to ignore me and my group for the rest of the night and we had to ask the poor food runner to get out checks for us.

{"id":95,"text":"I have been a loyal customer of this establishment for quite some time now, having both dined in and ordered delivery on numerous occasions. While I must admit that the food itself is pretty good and I have never had a bad meal here, the same cannot be said for the service. Let's start with the delivery service. Despite being frequent customers and tipping generously, we are always left waiting for an exorbitant amount of time. It is not unusual to wait at least an hour, if not an hour and a half, for our food to arrive. This is simply unacceptable and shows a lack of respect for their customers' time. As for the dine-in service, it is even worse. The staff never refills drinks in a timely manner, and our orders are often forgotten or incorrect. The seating is also incredibly uncomfortable, making the overall dining experience far from enjoyable. After enduring this disappointment on multiple occasions, we have made the decision to no longer dine in at this establishment. Furthermore, the delivery orders have been plagued with mistakes as well. On several occasions, items have been forgotten or incorrect. When we bring these issues to their attention, they become defensive, second-guess our claims, and even go as far as to call us liars. It is shocking to witness such unprofessional behavior from a business that should prioritize customer satisfaction. What is truly disheartening is their lack of effort to rectify their mistakes or make it up to us. In our own business, we understand the importance of keeping customers happy, as they are the lifeblood of any establishment. However, it seems that this establishment fails to grasp this concept. Considering the consistently poor service and the dismissive attitude towards their mistakes, it is clear that we need to start exploring other options to fulfill our breakfast and lunch needs in the area. Our loyalty and patience have been tested one too many times, and it is time to seek out an establishment that values and appreciates its customers.","label":"ai"}

Now, I ain't no expert when it comes to red varietals, but any wine lover would be blown away by their huge collection. Shout out to Chinedu (I hope I spelled that right) for being super helpful in finding the right wine. We were in a bit of a hurry to meet up with a buddy and catch a show, but he still took the time. And hey, I even got to shake hands with Joe, the regional manager. That dude knows what's up when it comes to expanding. This place is gonna be my new go-to for pizza, no doubt.

Now, I didn't end up doing business with these guys, but I gotta spill the beans on why. So, this dude named Andy rolls up to my place for an estimate on getting rid of a palm tree and grinding the stump. Before he even steps foot on my property, he tells me it's gonna be around 300 bucks, which is in line with what other tree experts were quoting me. Solid, right? Wrong! When he finally shows up, he hits me with a whopping $650 price tag! Double what everyone else was charging! Can you believe that? But wait, it gets better. This genius actually suggests I sell my palm tree. Now, any arborist worth their salt knows that ain't possible when the tree's outgrown its planter. Talk about clueless!

Their menu that day is pre made already. My boyfriend doesn't eat seafood so I had a concern because some food that was included were seafood like the crab cakes and lobster so I called the day before to ask if we can exchange the seafood into something like chicken. The host said it's ok. When we got thee the waiter said, the menu is already set up for that day and can't be changed. So I got upset because I was told something else. My bf was upset and wanted to leave! So finally he's willing to change the seafood menu. The food was great but will never come back ever again. 95% of the crowd are old people too!!!!

During my visit, I was inexplicably followed around the store by the manager, who refused to acknowledge my inquiries about her behavior. It was a bizarre and uncomfortable situation, especially considering I had done nothing to warrant such scrutiny. I later learned that this manager has a reputation for targeting minorities and making prejudiced remarks in front of her staff. It's appalling that someone in a position of authority would behave in such a discriminatory manner. The atmosphere in the store was tense and unwelcoming, and I felt like I was being unfairly judged. I would strongly discourage anyone from supporting this establishment with their patronage. There are plenty of other grocery stores that provide a more respectful and inclusive environment for their customers. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this Safeway at all costs.","label":"ai"}

When I told 'em about you, they didn't exactly jump for joy. But they always turn to me to fire up the Yelp app when they're clueless about where to eat. So, Yelp girl to the rescue! After reading out some of your rave reviews, they agreed to give it a shot. Though, I conveniently skipped the part about the long wait and just sold the good bits. All I wanted was to get them there. When we rocked up, the counter was buzzing and there were a couple of guys in line. We were a trio, ditched the others at the hotel who were too hungover. Well played, I'd say. The best part - as we joined the line, 5 dudes just up and left! We didn't have to wait a frickin' minute! Everything just fell into place. I ordered the Pan Roast Lobster, and that's where our love story began. The friendly waitress suggested a heat level of 6. It was bustling, so we waited about 20 minutes, maybe a smidge longer, but it flew by. I was totally engrossed watching the lone cook whip up dish after dish. The guy was like a tornado in that tiny space. When he finally served up the ginormous bowl, my eyes lit up. Huge chunks of lobster were swimming in my bowl. Then came the first bite. My taste buds just exploded. I can't even find the right words to describe how delicious that pan roast was. It was the definition of perfection. From the level 6 heat, to the succulent lobster, to the lobster bisque sauce, even the scoop of white rice in my bowl. I was head over heels in love with you. My buddies ordered the seafood pan roast and shrimp scampi (which came with pasta) but even after trying each other's dishes, I can confidently say, mine was the best. The portions were so huge that none of us could finish our meals. One of my mates suggested we should share next time. Share? What? Did he just dodge the fact that Yelp and Dave F. got us there? Big ups to your chef and waitress. They were non-stop, taking orders, clearing the counter, prepping orders, opening raw oysters or clams like it was child's play, and refilling drinks. All this while chatting up customers with a smile. I know some folks complain about the limited counter space with only about 20 seats, but I hope you don't expand. I love the vibe and the coziness. Despite being in the casino with no walls, it felt like a world of its own, thanks to the action in front and the delish food. Next time I'm in Vegas, trust me, I'm visiting my first love.

Also, at Mint, they're very professional as well. \\n\\nOnce inside, it's pretty messy, the crowd and patrons there aren't the ideal crowd you want to be around, neither at the El Hefe on Mill, it must be an El Hefe thing. :P An obnoxious, and irresponsible atmosphere. \\n\\nThe drinks weren't bad though, and the food might be good. Might come back for that.","label":"human"}
{"id":129,"text":"I was extremely disappointed with my experience at this establishment. Despite the positive reviews I had heard, my visit left much to be desired. The location itself was difficult to find and lacked proper signage. My husband and I decided to give it a try, but we were sorely let down. The special they offered on Valentine's Day was underwhelming, and the quality of the massages was subpar. Additionally, the cost of $30 for an hour was not worth the lackluster experience. Coming from Yakima, WA, where we had better options, this place was a complete letdown. I would not recommend it to anyone.","label":"ai"}

{"id":131,"text":"I ain't much of a sweet tooth kind of person, but I decided to give The Cupcakery a shot. Even though I'm not into cupcakes, I do love me some carrot cake. So we split a Bugsy, carrot cake with cream cheese topping. It was alright for a cupcake, but a tad too sweet for me. I let my wife handle most of it. On our way out, I saw they had mini cupcakes. Next time, I'll probably grab one of those - that's about all the sweet I can handle. They've got a good variety, so I might give some more a try. The minis should do the trick for me.","label":"ai"}
{"id":132,"text":"We have been coming to the Dragon Noodle for years. The food is good, the prices are a little high and the service is okay. I agree with some of the other Yelpers. If you sit in the back section of the place it is a bit gloomy. We liked the place before the remodel. It had cheesy decor and t-shirts for sale. \\n\\nAfter a long day at a trade show we just want to relax and not venture too far from the hotel. The Dragon Noodle is never that busy so you can usually get a table for any number of sized party. \\n\\nWe hardly ever order from the sushi menu since the prices look high and we have never have been thrilled with what we have had in the past.\\n\\nOur group sticks to the Chinese menu and is always satisfied with the portions and taste. Our favorites are the Kung Pao Chicken, Mongolian Beef and Wonton Soup. A group of 6 of us ate last week for $140.","label":"human"}

{"id":134,"text":"My oh my! If only you knew the drama and the stress that us girls went through in order to choose which hotel we'd stay at in Vegas on our girls trip. We went from a slew of hotels to stay at... our heart was set on the Venetian because a) It's a 5 star hotel and b) It's sleek and sexy! Normally I stay at the Bellagio and my friend stays at the Wynn so we're used to NICE FANCY hotels... in the end we chose the Venetian and the Palazzo suite for our stay... 1400 square feet of ballin! Or so it looked like from the picture...\\n\\nArrived on Friday at 11:30AM to check in... my friend hadn't arrived yet so even though check in isn't until 3PM I tried anyway... LONG line to check in... LOOOOONG line! An employee saw me enter the velvet ropes and asked if I was checking in and I said yes... he said that if I didn't mind going up the elevator that was no wait to check in upstairs... score! So I went up stairs to check in... my room wasn't ready and I requested a couch with a pull out sofa sleeper but I was told that there were no rooms available with the pull out sleeper... but that if one was available Saturday they could switch our rooms... a lot of trouble if you ask me to switch rooms so I asked about a roll away bed and they said normally it's $35\/day but they would give me one for free since no sofa sleeper was available. Brownie points for them! They said they would call me as soon as the room was ready but that they would hold my bags for me... easy enough. We went shopping!! \\n\\nI got a call around 2PM that the room was ready. My friend arrived at almost 4:30PM so we checked in thereafter. Got our keys and headed up to our suite... arrived at the END of a VERY LONG HALLWAY and was ready to see our pimpin suite... opened the doors and..............................................................................\\n\\nwas extremely disappointed. BEYOND disappointed! Um was this the same room as the pictures?!?!?!!? Cuz it sure didn't look like it. The rugs were worn and dirty. There was no L shaped couch. Just a dirty yellow \\\"love seat\\\" which didn't look very lovey. Two small chairs and a small table in the living room. The living room looked... empty. Pathetic. Lonely. Everything looked... OLD. The bathroom was nice so I'll give it that. But that's about it. We called the front desk about not having an L shaped couch which I was told we'd get when I checked in... he stated it only comes with a \\\"love seat\\\" and I mentioned it was fraying, dirty, and old and that it wasn't lovey or lovely at all and all he did was apologize. My friend and I were... confused. Debating on what to do. We were supposed to meet up with 2 other friends to go to the Wynn Buffet for dinner so we decided to go do dinner and talk about it. Talking was short. We hated the room and felt cheated! So after dinner we went back to the front desk, IN PERSON, no phone calls...\\n\\nWe inquired about having a room that was \\\"more 5 star quality\\\" and the nice gentleman helping us started to show us bigger suites in his book... we explained it wasn't the SIZE of the suite that was the problem... hell we had 1400 square feet which is practically a house!... it was what was IN the suite that LACKED 5 stars! We listed everything and then he did some researching... and he showed us a different suite at the newer Palazzo connected to the Venetian and asked us if we'd consider moving there... and we agreed. He even mentioned that our suite has yet to be renovated and that it is older but that they are renovating next year... helllooooo FALSE ADVERTISING!!! The pics look NOTHING like the room itself. Ughh it was GROSS! \\n\\nBellman took all our stuff to our new suite in the Palazzo... and it was a BOMB ASS SUITE! (I'll write a review under Palazzo for that one)... but Venetian, you FAIL, an absolute EPIC FAIL... and never ever ever ever again will I even CONSIDER staying with you... lesson learned for me and my friend... BELLAGIO AND WYNN all the way!\\n\\nSide note: lots of great shopping, TAO is an awesome club!... and the gondola ride outside is super cute!","label":"human"}
{"id":135,"text":"This was our 4th trip to the restaurant and if I would have written this review after the 3rd trip, I would have given it 5 stars. Needless to say, the food was spectacular as it had been the last 3 times we had been there. I gave it 3 stars on this review due to the poor service. We waited at least 10 minutes to have a server come to our table after we were seated with no apologies for the wait and that was after I went back to the hostess stand to ask where our server was. She had indicated he was at the bar getting drinks....10 minutes! Really! Asked our server about the \\\"Foodie Friday\\\" special and he did not seem to know what I was talking about but finally the light bulb went on and he said he had to check on it. Waited a long time for our drinks to come out and another long wait for the food. I will state again that the food has always been excellent and it was this time as well. We ordered a slice of their Pina Colada cake to go and that took another 10 minutes. I had already paid the check and we were just sitting there waiting for the cake to go box to come. Poor, poor service and top that off with a waiter who seemed to be clueless and lacking in any sense of urgency....not a good combination. I will go back and will actually ask to speak to the manager on our next visit. Can't say enough about the quality of the food and that is the reason we will give it another shot.","label":"human"}
{"id":136,"text":"A few years ago I had an absolutely amazing customer service experience at this apple store. I dropped my Macbook and had to replace it right before new ones were coming out. When the new, far more powerful ones were released, I figured it would be worth a shot to bring it in and say that mine had crashed a few times (that's true). They not only replaced it with one of the new ones, but gave me a hard drive that was twice the size of the one I had purchased. There was no charge whatsoever and I was literally in and out in under ten minutes. It was incredible. It made me feel like my decision to buy a premium product for a premium price had paid off, since I got premium service. I told everyone about it. \\n\\nFast forward to three weeks ago when I bought a new Iphone 6. I reserved a phone on the web site and took the bus to the mall. When I showed up, almost two hours had passed since I placed the order. Nonetheless, when I showed up at the store, it hadn't been processed. So my phone was in the back of the store, my payment had gone through, but their system hadn't handled it yet. Instead of figuring out a way to resolve this, the employee I spoke to told me to wait for an email. I ended up waiting in the food court for another hour. That sure wasn't premium service, but it as the sort of thing I could overlook.\\n\\nThen last week I heard from my dad, who is the account holder on our family plan. Apparently, through no fault of my own, I had somehow ended up selecting a billing option that was going to cost us about $300 a year for no good reason whatsoever. (The entire explanation is too boring to go into-- trust me, though, it was their fault).\\n\\nAfter \\\\ many, many, many hours on the phone w\/ ATT, it was determined that I needed approval from an Apple Store manager to switch the plan. So I called them. At least I tried to. They didn't pick up their phone. For four hours. I started a web support chat. The rep tried to call them. They didn't pick up. Finally, after hours I screamed at the automated prompt: \\\"Put me on with a f***ing person!\\\" That cued an automated response: \\\"We are sorry for your frustration!\\\" Then, magically, I got a person. (By the way, no one ever seemed to acknowledge how insanely unacceptable it was that they didn't answer their phone. )\\n\\nTo make a long story a little shorter-- when I finally went into the store, they were unable to help me because despite the fact that ATT and Apple have been partners for over seven years, they are still completely incapable of communicating with each other. (Again, it's a long, stupid, frustrating story. You'll have to take my word for it.) \\n\\nWhen it became clear that we were going to be out 300 bucks, I asked the manager what he could do for me to take away the bad taste caused by their utter incompetence. He hemmed and hawed and then asked, \\\"What would it take to make you happy?\\\" I replied, \\\"An iPad. If you give me an iPad, I'll not only be happy, but I'll go back to raving about what incredible customer service Apple has.\\\" He scoffed at that and offered me... a case for my iPhone. That's right, he offered me a $20 piece of plastic to compensate me for at least 25 hours on the phone and $300 in losses. I scoffed at that and we finally agreed to an upgrade to Applecare+ and a replacement cord for my laptop. It felt like I had to fight for every inch here. \\n\\nI told these guys exactly what they could do to make me happy and they refused to do it. And lest you think that this was an unreasonable request, think about it this way: I've probably spent somewhere in the neighborhood of $10,000 on Apple products in the last fifteen years. I'd likely spend tens of thousands of dollars more over the course of my life. I'd continue to tell people about what incredible customer service Apple has. They could have secured thousands in profits for a few hundred bucks. They chose not to. \\n\\nApple products used to be better than their competitors'. They're not anymore, and I knew that. The only reason I kept buying them was because I thought I'd get a premium experience--that if there were a problem it would be solved in a way that impressed me without wasting hours on the phone. They don't have that advantage anymore. They're just the guys selling the same thing as everyone else for much, much more money.\\n\\nNice work, Apple. \\n\\n(The only reason they get two stars is that one employee, Patrick, was really very good in dealing with the morons at ATT. He's also the only person who seemed sincerely sorry about my experience. Thanks, Patrick. You did a MUCH better job than your bosses. Tell them to pick up their phone when it rings. Oh, and I'd still be glad to take that iPad if you guys decide that spending a few hundred bucks now is worth thousands and thousands in profits over the next twenty years. Something tells me that this isn't in the cards.)","label":"human"}

Arrived and tried to get a room on the same floor as my sister in law. They said we could but our room wouldn't be ready till 5 PM, and it was only 11 AM. We decided not to wait and took a different room. Big mistake! We were promised a strip view on the 9th floor as compensation. But all we saw was the casino roof. 1 star down. I tried not to let it bother me. But then the restroom door jammed and I got stuck. My mother in law had to force the door open. Another star down. We went to the pool to relax. The pool was small and crowded. The water looked dirty. I wouldn't even swim in it. The bathroom lighting was poor and the toilet flush was loud. When we were getting ready for dinner, my mother in law said the tub was full of water due to poor drainage. So we were late for dinner. Another star down. The pillows were too hard. I had to sleep without them. There was a wet stain on my side of the bed. I stepped on it with bare feet. I wish I could give zero stars. I won't stay here again. It was all so crammed I couldn't even complain. I just wanted to leave. There are cheaper hotels on the strip. Don't waste your money here. You've been warned.","label":"ai"}

{"id":142,"text":"I recently had the pleasure of visiting Salon Renew in the charming old town area of Scottsdale. Tucked away in a tiny 16x16 room-sized space, this 2-person salon exceeded all of my expectations. The ambiance was surprisingly inviting, with small chandeliers hanging from the ceiling and a cozy patio area for waiting and restroom facilities. I was delighted to find a selection of coffee, wine, beer, and snacks available, making my visit even more enjoyable. I must admit that I was initially hesitant to visit Salon Renew, as it had no online presence or reviews to provide me with any reassurance. However, a friend had recommended it to me, and I decided to take a leap of faith. I was particularly nervous because I was planning to donate a significant length of my hair and was in need of a drastic change. My fear of haircuts and anxiety about the process are well-known, and I tend to require a lot of reassurance and guidance from the stylist. To my surprise, Samantha, the stylist at Salon Renew, managed to put me at ease from the moment I arrived. She took the time to thoroughly discuss the haircut I wanted and how it would align with my lifestyle. Her ability to understand my needs and concerns was truly remarkable. She even provided me with a generous glass of wine to help calm my nerves. Throughout the entire process, she was patient, attentive, and incredibly skilled. I was thrilled with the end result - a low-maintenance haircut that perfectly suited my lifestyle and required minimal styling. Samantha's ability to listen and truly understand my preferences was a breath of fresh air. I've had my fair share of experiences with stubborn and unaccommodating stylists in the past, but my visit to Salon Renew was a complete game-changer. It may seem simple, but finding a stylist who is willing to listen and adapt to your needs is a rare and valuable thing. I understand that one review may not carry much weight, especially for a place with minimal online presence. However, I took a chance on Salon Renew and it exceeded all of my expectations. I urge anyone considering a visit to take the same leap of faith - I have no doubt that you'll be as pleasantly surprised as I was. Baby steps in the right direction, indeed. I can't wait to return for my next haircut at Salon Renew.","label":"ai"}

No upsell or suggestive sell? \\nWe ordered all of our apps and drinks and then had to flag down the waiter to order our meal. Truly felt as if we were not important.

A few chairs and tables scattered about, but this is located near the plaza with plenty of outdoor seating near the big fountain, should weather permit. \\n\\nOn this visit, I decided to get one of the ice cream cupcakes to try later - it was fine.

{"id":166,"text":"I recently visited this establishment with high hopes, but unfortunately, my experience left much to be desired. The coffee was decent, I will admit. I ordered a white chocolate mocha while my husband opted for a hot chai latte. Both drinks were tasty, but at $4.75 each, they were overpriced compared to Starbucks. Yes, the flavor was smoother, but the price difference was hardly justified. Now, let's talk about the food. We ordered a ham and cheese croissant toasted and a quiche lorraine. The sandwich was enjoyable, but the quiche had an odd texture that was off-putting. To make matters worse, the food took an additional 15 minutes to arrive compared to our coffee. And at $7.75 for these tiny portions, I couldn't help but feel ripped off. Overall, the experience was underwhelming. Spending almost $27 here left me unsatisfied and still hungry. For that amount, I could have enjoyed a filling meal at The Cracked Egg, accompanied by a delicious cup of joe. I doubt I'll be returning unless I suddenly feel the urge to embrace a hipster and fancy atmosphere.","label":"ai"}
{"id":167,"text":"I really wanted to like this establishment, but unfortunately, my experience has been consistently disappointing. As it is conveniently located across the street from my workplace, I had high hopes for it being a reliable lunch option. However, in the past three visits, I have been let down. Each time I have ordered the chicken Caesar salad, they have been out of a crucial ingredient, but have not informed me until I receive my order. The first time, they were out of parmesan cheese, the second time they substituted the usual sliced white meat chicken with shredded leg meat, and today they only had half a small to-go cup of dressing. These are essential components for a salad that only consists of four ingredients. If I had been informed beforehand, I would not have ordered the Caesar salad. Additionally, the prices seem steep for the quality and quantity of the food. I can find a better salad for the same price at many other places uptown, so it seems they are charging for the convenience of their location. Overall, I am disappointed with the inconsistency and lack of value at this establishment.","label":"ai"}
{"id":168,"text":"Despite having come across several negative reviews, I decided to give this place a benefit of the doubt. Upon my arrival, my wife and I were greeted by Alladin, the store owner who oozed a sense of confidence. He mentioned his experience working with pro athletes, displaying a sound knowledge of his craft. He recommended a suit to me, assuring that it would be worth the investment. Subsequently, I bought an $800 Hugo Boss suit, and returned for alterations. Alladin took meticulous measurements, marking and pinning the jacket accordingly. A week later, we returned to pick up the suit. There was a minor mix-up with the suits initially, but we quickly got hold of the correct one. Alladin didn't suggest I try it on, but I took the initiative to ensure a good fit. To my surprise, the jacket wasn't altered and the pants seam was slightly off. Alladin initially quoted a $200 fee for the unaltered jacket, which we found unreasonable. After a discussion, he agreed to rectify the jacket and sent us off to a complimentary lunch while he made the required adjustments. The Hugo Boss material seemed a bit challenging for him. Nonetheless, he managed to work around it despite the visible stitch marks on the pant legs. The end result wasn't perfect, but it was certainly wearable. In summary, while the experience wasn't flawless, it was an interesting encounter. Yes, there were a few hiccups along the way, but Alladin was willing to rectify them. If you're seeking a straightforward, no-frills tailoring service, this might not be your go-to place. However, if you're open to a unique experience and are willing to communicate your needs clearly, this place is worth considering.","label":"ai"}

The price was right at $99\/night, so I can overlook some of its flaws. The rooms are big and the beds are firm, which I liked. The staff is friendly, but they're a bit all over the place. The location is decent, just a short walk to downtown. The conference facilities are good too. On the downside, the place is a bit disorganized and some things still need updating.

{"id":202,"text":"I recently visited this establishment and was pleasantly surprised by its charming atmosphere. The house itself is adorable, with little rooms that give it a cozy and homey feel. However, the true disappointment came when I tried the food. I ordered the buffalo scramble, hoping for a flavorful and satisfying breakfast. Unfortunately, the dish fell short of my expectations. Despite the promising ingredients - ground buffalo, onion, bell pepper, tomato, mushroom, and jack cheese - the dish lacked any real flavor. The overwhelming amount of bland and unappealing cheese only added to the disappointment. Additionally, the texture of the ground buffalo was off-putting, and the lack of seasoning in both the scramble and the accompanying hash browns left much to be desired. My partner ordered the blueberry pancakes, which were also a letdown. The pancakes were drenched in an overly sweet blueberry sauce, making them almost sickeningly sweet. It was a shame to see such potential wasted on a dish that was simply too sugary to enjoy. Despite the disappointing food, I will say that the coffee was a redeeming factor. The quality of the coffee was excellent and provided a much-needed pick-me-up after the lackluster meal. In conclusion, while the atmosphere of the establishment was charming, the food did not live up to expectations. The lack of flavor and poor execution of what could have been delicious dishes left much to be desired.

The selection of draft beers was impressive, and I was delighted to find that they had all the options I was hoping for, including Captain Morgan. As for the pricing of the fries, while some may argue that it seems a bit steep, I believe it's important to consider the overall quality and presentation. The fries at Alchemy are undoubtedly top-notch, perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection. Sometimes, it's worth paying a little extra for that level of excellence. Overall, my experience at Alchemy was fantastic. The establishment has made significant improvements, both in terms of pricing and service. I highly recommend giving them a try and forming your own opinion. Don't let negative reviews overshadow the positive changes that have taken place. Alchemy is definitely worthy of your time and money.","label":"ai"}

{"id":208,"text":"I stayed at this establishment and was not impressed. The room was clean and the flat screen TV was a nice touch, but I was disgusted to find a white\/creamy-ish stain on the runner of one of the beds. It made me question the cleanliness of the entire room and I did not want a reminder of who else had slept in that bed. The room was comfortable overall, but the stain left a bad taste in my mouth. The restaurants were also a disappointment. The food at Le Cafe was subpar, and the line at Le Village Buffet was so long that we settled for a crepe stand instead. Everything we ate was mediocre at best, and nothing stood out as exceptional. The casino was small and I ended up losing money, which left me with negative feelings about the whole area. I may stay here again if I had no other options, but if I could afford a nicer hotel, I would not give this place a second look. Au Revoir Paris.","label":"ai"}

Despite their claim of providing exceptional service, I found the staff to be unprofessional and lacking basic courtesy. The so-called attention to detail was nonexistent, as my requests were completely ignored. The ambiance was anything but wonderful, with obnoxiously loud concert DVDs playing on oversized screens that only added to the chaotic atmosphere. The supposedly comfortable massage chairs were worn out and uncomfortable. As for cleanliness, I was appalled by the lack of hygiene in this establishment. Needless to say, I will not be returning and would strongly advise against wasting your time and money here.","label":"ai"}

{"id":212,"text":"Visited the Smith Center many times. It's a beautiful place with excellent acoustics. Saw KD Lang perform there and the sound was brilliant. But my 4th of July experience was disappointing. The sound was a mess. Couldn't make out the lyrics or dialogue. Didn't understand a word from the chubby kid. The show might have been funny, I guess. The visual jokes were certainly good. The sound was too loud. My hearing was muffled for the rest of the night. Whoever was in charge of the sound needs a new job. Maybe in a factory where loud noise and unclear speech are standard. I'll return to Smith Center because I know the sound can be great. But this show felt like a waste of 200 bucks.","label":"ai"}

Pat makes a great breakfast and Bob provides good company during the meal.

{"id":220,"text":"If you want high quality suits and good customer service, DO NOT go to this store!! My family scheduled a Scottsdale trip at the end of the school year for our kids. In our rush to get out of Seattle, I only packed half my swimsuit. The closest swimsuit place to our hotel was Everything But Water in the very upscale Kierland Commons. My first impression was friendly, helpful and attentive service. I found a suit that I loved with the necessary underwire in the top. It was close to $200 but I figured a quality suit is worth the price. I even bought a cute cover up that the sales girl suggested. Fast forward two days. After day two of swimming, I took off the suit and realized that one of the underwires had ripped through the fabric and had almost come completely out of the suit. I immediately took the suit back to the store. I thought for sure they would allow me to return the suit because it was clearly defective. No way!! They only offered to exchange the suit even though you could see that the new top would have the exact same issue. I said I did not want such a poor quality suit and I wanted my money back. Still no refund. To make matters worse, my original sales girl kept smirking at the other sales girls as if I was trying to pull a fast one. I left with the new top because I had no other choice. I felt completely robbed!! \\nI come from the land of Costco and Nordstrom where customer service is tops. This store should take a lesson.\\n\\nUPDATE\\nAfter posting this review here and on the company Facebook page, I was contacted by Michele at Everything But Water corporate. She was amazing!! She contacted me personally, apologized for the inconvenience, assured me that I would be given a refund and let me know that my experience did not reflect company policy. This was all done within a week of me arriving back home. Do I still think that the service I received at Kierland Commons in Scottsdale (by one particular associate) was awful? Yes, hence the 1 star rating. However, the company took great care of me after the fact, (Michele in particular) so I will be checking out the Bellevue, WA store to see if I have better luck in finding my perfect suit. If Michele reflects the overall quality of employees at Everything but Water, I give them 5 stars! !","label":"human"}
{"id":221,"text":"This hotel and I definitely got off to a bad start. After checking in, we go up to our room and try to open the door, only to find that the lock\/handle is broken. I try to open the door one more time and the handle gives way and breaks and cuts my hand in the process. We head all the way back down to let them know of the situation and they give us the exact same room three floors up, but we don't get any upgrade for our troubles. Lame. My only other beef with this hotel was the stupid night stand light that would not turn off. It was extremely difficult to fall asleep with a light that stayed on right above your bed. Other than that, my stay was pretty pleasant.\\n\\nThe suites are amazing! They are huge in size and can comfortably fit seven people without a hitch. Keeping the guests in mind, the Palazzo provides a pullout bed, which is actually comfortable for the suites. The beds are very comfortable, and these kinds of suites were made for large groups. As always, the bathrooms are also large and nicely decorated. There is even a small television in the bathroom, which was new to me! I thought the remote control to operate the curtains and blinds were a nice touch. I thought those kinds of things were reserved for hotels like the Wynn, but Palazzo delivered. \\n\\nThe best part of staying here? Easy and quick access to the tables downstairs - specifically craps. Thanks for the good times and paying me and my friends off on that heater table. I thin we took over a grand from that table total. I would definitely stay here next time because of the comfort, convenience, and service. Just try not to cut my hand or keep me awake next time!","label":"human"}

She arrived late and left before we could even express our satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the photos. Managing two children (6\/3) is tough as parents and it seemed even more daunting for her as a photographer. Lex barely interacted with them, resulting in stiff and unnatural looking pictures. Her suggestions for locations, outfits and poses did not reflect our family's personality or style at all. Why not go to a big box store where at least you have a guaranteed quality, despite the cheesy backgrounds and young photographers? Lex's pricing was deceptive with additional hidden charges and her limited options hardly catered to our needs. In the end, you might not even want any of the pictures because they won't reflect you or your family well.","label":"ai"}

Small oyster bar inside and a dozen or so tables for dining 'al fresco' (there's no way you're forgetting you're still inside). The breakfast menu was simple enough - omelet's, a bagel sammie, pancakes - nothing out of the ordinary. My omelet (the Vegas) was filled with a few veggies, some avocado, cheddar and bacon. All super at soaking up the booze from the prior evening. The mimosas are $5, if you need to crush that hangover, and are standard sized but tasty.

{"id":237,"text":"I was excited to try out this sushi restaurant after hearing about their fresh fish and reasonable prices. As a sushi lover from the east coast, I was eager to find a go-to spot in the valley. However, my overall experience was disappointing. The service was consistently poor, with long wait times and rude waitresses. I once waited 25 minutes for an itemized check, only to receive an unitemized one. The lack of attentiveness and disregard for customer needs left a sour taste in my mouth. Despite the tempting happy hour prices, the consistently bad service has finally pushed me to seek out a new sushi restaurant. It's a shame because I truly enjoyed the quality of their sushi, but the consistently poor service has made it difficult to justify returning. If you have time to spare and don't mind being ignored or receiving subpar service, then this place might be worth a visit.","label":"ai"}

I don't know where he was during the first 30 minutes of our meal but other bussers would come and pick up one thing, or nothing at all. At one point my friend piled dishes on the seat next to her, and I had some on the table stacked, hoping someone would clear it. The food runners should really be picking things up that are overcrowding the table so they can make room for the new items, our runner must've notice how much unused dish ware we had because she told us a busser would be over soon. Note she didn't take a single thing off of the table.\\n\\nThey need to really work on keeping tables bussed and unused items out of the way. Maybe throughout the meal drop new share plates... \\n\\nIt's unfortunate that almost a month after opening this place is still dis functional. \\n\\nAt one point I saw what looked like a customer (because she was in street clothes and holding a purse I assumed she was a customer) completely rip into a food runner. I couldn't tell what was going on but it happened on the floor in front of guests, management, staff... It was so awkward. After making out what she was saying she must've been a manager. It's extremely inappropriate to speak to your staff the way that woman did and esp on the floor! Take it to the back! Poor girl. \\n\\nRegardless, the food was wonderful and the staff seemed happy.

{"id":241,"text":"I recently had the pleasure of visiting this establishment for the first time on a Wednesday evening, and let me tell you, it was an incredible discovery. I had no idea this place even existed, but now that I do, I couldn't be happier. The atmosphere of the restaurant is just perfect. It strikes a great balance in terms of size - not too big, not too small. It can accommodate large parties or intimate couples without feeling crowded. The only thing to note is that it's quite dimly lit, so if you prefer a brighter setting, I recommend choosing a table with plenty of candles nearby. The interior is adorable, with a modern and fresh update. And the best part? It's located on 17th, away from the hustle and bustle of the Southside, so you won't have to deal with rowdy college kids. The service at this establishment is top-notch. The servers and even the owner, whom I had the pleasure of meeting, were absolutely wonderful. They are knowledgeable about the menu and genuinely care about your dining experience. I believe this is partly because of the manageable size of the place, which allows them to provide attentive service without feeling overwhelmed. Now, let's talk about the food. Oh my, the Butternut Squash Gnocchi with Boar Ragu! I can still taste it in my mouth. The gnocchi were incredibly fresh and the best I've ever had. They practically melted in my mouth, and I didn't want the experience to end. The boar ragu was equally fresh and the combination of flavors was simply mind-blowing. It's a pairing that I would have never thought of, but it worked so well. I may sound dramatic, but I truly savored every last bite and even resorted to licking up the sauce on the plate with leftover bread. It was that good. For dessert, we decided to try the chocolate bread pudding, and boy, was it the best decision. It had a texture more akin to a molten lava cake and quick bread, rather than a traditional \"pudding.\" In my opinion, when a restaurant offers bread pudding as a dessert, it's a sign that it's going to be amazing. Not many places dare to make bread pudding nowadays, but I believe it can be incredibly unique. The only other place that comes close to rivaling this dessert option is NOLA, with their unforgettable red velvet bread pudding. Overall, I am thrilled to have discovered this establishment and it has earned a well-deserved spot in my \"nice night out\" rotation. The perfect atmosphere, impeccable service, and outstanding food make it a must-visit. Whether you're looking for a romantic dinner for two or a gathering with friends, this place is sure to exceed your expectations.","label":"ai"}

{"id":268,"text":"My husband and I stayed here in February 2012 for USA Sevens. We picked it because it was on the strip and was better priced and looked the cleanest then the other hotels. We stayed in the East tower, which I do recommend staying at because it's the newest part of the Luxor and the cleanest. The ONLY thing we really couldn't stand was how far the parking lot is to the tower. Between going through the entire casino, bars, and the whole pyramid to the other side it was horrible after a 9 hour drive with a bunch of luggage! The room it self was really nice, the desk chair was a bit dirty. But all in all we would stay there again. The Luxor buffet was the best one we've been to compared to a few others on the strip. It was clean and had great options for breakfast.","label":"human"}

{"id":272,"text":"I recently visited Luisa's and I have to say, it's hands down the best pizza joint in Charlotte. The owners have gone to great lengths to ensure they capture the authentic taste of pizza from Italy, and it shows. Their wood-fired brick oven is the secret ingredient that sets their pizzas apart from the rest. You can see the wood burning inside the oven right from the counter, and it's clear that this is the key to their success. My wife is a pizza aficionado and she has tried many places in the city, but Luisa's tops her list. We haven't explored the entire menu, but everything we've tried so far has been top-notch. The only downside is that it's a little hard to find, but honestly, that's okay with me because it means it's not overly crowded. If I could, I would give Luisa's six stars. The dedication to capturing the true taste of Italian pizza is evident in every bite, and I can't wait to go back for more.","label":"ai"}

While there was a long line at the rental counter, the staff worked quickly to get through the queue. I did find it inconvenient that they required a $200 hold and credit check for debit card users, but I understand the need for security. The rental process was straightforward, although I would have preferred more personalized service when choosing a vehicle. The Ford Fiesta I was assigned had some issues with the brakes and the color wasn't to my liking, but it got me from A to B without any major problems. I appreciated the affordable insurance options, even though I ultimately opted out. While the experience wasn't as luxurious as some other rental companies, I found the overall value to be worth it.

They put the blame on the company who sold me the driveshaft saying it was welded too short but when I brought it in to a separate place for a second opinion they measured the driveshaft and told me it was the correct length.

After weighing our options between Sula and Wooche, we decided on the latter and were beyond satisfied with our decision! The selection of meats was impressive, offering a range of ribs, octopus, and chicken to choose from. The interactive element of grilling our own meat added a fun touch to our dining experience. The staff were attentive, replacing our grill once it became dirty, and promptly clearing away finished plates. The \"cooked food\" section wasn't our favorite, but it didn't detract from our overall enjoyment. For around $15, the value for money was excellent. Our meal even included a dessert of fruit and a refreshing, sweet rice drink. While some critics may compare it to LA's offerings, we believe for a Vegas establishment, it's one of the best in town. For these reasons, I'm happy to award it a solid 4 stars.","label":"ai"}

Definitely beyond the crispy stage and moving into the rock stage. Anyway, so that wasn't so great, but the french toast was legitimately tasty. Was it $11 tasty? I guess where it goes wrong (for me) is that I used to get a stuffed French toast from Dozen (back when they were open) that was seriously good stuff that probably cost about the same. So... in the matchup against good ole Dozen's Sunday brunch, this couldn't compare. And that made me sad. =(\\n\\nWe're game to give it another try, but it's just a Meh to us.

Additionally, their sizing options were completely nonsensical. Who on earth wants an 8\" or 11\" sub? It would be much more practical if they offered a 6 or 12-inch option.

Overall, our dining experience at Scottsdale Station was disappointing. While the ambiance was nice, it lacked the charm and coziness of the previous location. The menu was exciting at first, as it seemed to be the same as the old Carefree Station menu, but the execution fell short. My husband's dish, the Pollo Fundido, was excellent and exceeded expectations. However, my Korean Shortribs were a letdown. They lacked the promised flavors and did not resemble shortribs in any way. They tasted more like pot roast, which was good but not what I wanted or expected. Furthermore, the service was subpar. Our beloved sushi nachos never arrived, and when we brought it up to our server, she seemed dismissive and almost accusing. It was also frustrating that the food was not properly paced, with our salads coming out before the nachos and the entrees arriving without the nachos at all. Additionally, our server seemed overwhelmed and rushed throughout the evening, making it difficult to get her attention when needed. In conclusion, while Scottsdale Station has potential with its beautiful ambiance and familiar menu, the execution and service need significant improvement.

Secondly, I don't think they train the staff very well because when we asked for napkins, she gave us 3 pieces.. we had 4 people in our party.. I mean, give us a little more. No need to skimp on paper napkins... And third (which was the worst), they ran out of dumplings! We ordered pork & zucchini which came out right away however, she said they were still making the pork & cabbage. We thought it would be maybe a 15-20min wait... but we ended up sitting there for over an hour. If they were out, she could've told us at the very beginning so we could've chosen a different flavor or just skipped it totally. \\nThe four of us ended up cancelling the pork & cabbage ones since we had to leave. Very disappointing. Lucky for them, their dumplings reminded me of the ones my grandma use to make back at home. The skin is hand rolled and chewy just the way I like it. The dumpling is stuffed to the brim with porky goodness and the juices drip off the skin once you bite into it. Dip the dumpling into some vinegar and hot sauce and you have the perfect dumpling. We also ordered some of the apps such as the chicken wings (skip), popcorn chicken (good), and liang ban fen pi (noodles were too long, difficult to mix with the non-existent peanut sauce). Just stuff yourself with dumpling goodness. \\n\\nTIP: Wait a few more weeks for this place to work out some of their kinks before you go or you might not even be able to get the dumplings!","label":"human"}

The place was clean, but man, it had that typical government building vibe going on. You know what I mean, right? Gloomy, fluorescent lighting, the whole shebang. But hey, I was in and outta there in just half an hour. Now, let's talk about the folks working there. The girl at the counter was a sweetheart - friendly and nice.

Oh, and did I mention he's so overweight that I doubt he could stop anyone from causing mischief if they wanted to? Alright, here's the story that's still fresh in my mind and has me all annoyed. So, I walk in and the guard goes, \"Hi, do you need some help?\" So far, so good, right? I reply, \"Yes, I'm here for a typhoid vaccine.\" And you know what this genius says? \"Okay, you need to fill out the white form\" while pointing at the wall. Cool, I head over to the wall to grab the form, and suddenly, he drops a bomb on me - \"We don't allow food and drink in here.\" Couldn't he have mentioned that before I started walking over to the wall? Ugh! Alright, now I'm heading out, following the guard's instructions. But guess what? He points to the other side of the building and says, \"You need to use the exit door.\" Seriously, dude? You couldn't have told me that earlier? At this point, I'm still trying to give the guy the benefit of the doubt. Rules are rules, right? Maybe they've got some fancy security camera stuff going on. I head back inside, only to find the \"Check-in starts here\" table with the same damn forms I saw online, complete with clipboards and pens. So, naturally, I ask the guard, \"Are these the right forms?\" And you know what he says? \"No, you need the one on the wall.\" I walk over to the wall, and what do I see? The forms on the wall are the exact same as the ones on the table, just without the clipboards and pens. And to top it off, the white forms are clearly labeled \"Childhood vaccines (under 18 years old).\" I ask him, \"Are you sure you don't mean the blue one?\" The blue forms are labeled \"travel vaccines,\" by the way. And you know what he says? \"No, the white one.\" I swear, this guy gets a kick out of making people's lives a tad more difficult. It's like he's a supervillain - Inconvenience Man! So, all in all, the place was decent, but that security guard really put a damper on my experience. I just hope they realize that he's not the best person to have as the first point of contact for the visitors. Anyway, if you can survive his power trip, you'll be fine. Good luck, folks!","label":"ai"}

{"id":326,"text":"I recently had the pleasure of dining at this establishment for a co-worker's going away dinner, and despite a few hiccups, I must say that my overall experience was quite positive. Admittedly, the food did take longer than expected to arrive, leaving our glasses empty for a while. It was a bit puzzling since the restaurant wasn't particularly crowded. However, the mandatory 18% gratuity seemed a bit steep considering the slower service. But let's focus on the bright side. The atmosphere, albeit described as dull and boring, provided a cozy and intimate setting for our gathering. Finally, after a wait of approximately 65 minutes, our meals arrived. It was unfortunate that the cooked food was served cold, and the timing of the raw food was off. Nonetheless, the flavors were satisfactory, though not as amazing as some authentic dishes I've had in Korea. While the service could have been more attentive and apologetic about the delay, I must commend the staff for their efficiency in handling our orders. And although the restaurant may not be located in the best neighborhood, I felt safe and secure throughout my visit. In conclusion, despite the wait and a few flaws in the service, my experience at this establishment was far from terrible. With some improvements in timing and attention to detail, this place has the potential to become a truly outstanding dining destination.","label":"ai"}

{"id":330,"text":"My 14-night stay at South Point was marred by this deli's below par offerings. Six times, my wife and I grudgingly ate one of their toasted cinnamon bagels with cream cheese and a coffee in our room. We were further let down when I ordered a large cheese Danish. Though it was freshly baked, the disappointing lack of cheese was evident. This warrants a mere 2.5-star rating. An unfortunate incident occurred when my wife fell ill, which forced us to cancel our dinner plans. I opted for a tea and a bowl of chicken noodle soup from the deli to soothe her. Despite being effective, the soup was exorbitantly priced. I also ordered a corned beef on rye for myself. While it was indeed tender and virtually fat-free, the sandwich was overpriced. The additional cost for a full sandwich compared to a half was negligible, but still felt unjustified. I would give the soup and sandwich 4 stars, but the overall experience was far from satisfying.","label":"ai"}

Brandon the manager was very rude and condescending. I asked to talk to his manager, Pat another manager called her and she would not talk to me. This took about 5min and then all the sudden the police show up and tell us to leave. Brandon did not even ask me to leave he just called the police and had them tell us to leave. I have never had the police called on me. Officer Stranger then took my info and treated me like I was a criminal and literally escorted me and my friend out.

{"id":332,"text":"I had a hysterectomy\/hernia repair done in December where the wound opened up in January. I received a call from my physician asking me to come to Mercy Gilbert where she was on call over the weekend so that we could take a closer look at the wound. Dr Jennifer Reitz of Advanced Surgical promised me a direct admit to the hospital --on the way there we received a call from the call center stating I would have to go through the ER. I arrived in the ER and was taken back - before vitals or anything else was done I was informed by the RN that I was being placed on a Psych hold because I had made statements that I planned to kill myself. I immediately went to run - they called security who came in and tackled me dragging my open wound across the floor and then used my face to clear a supply rack. I was then thrown in a gurney and halled down the hallway and told I would have to take any clothes off that were mine and be in there clothes. They would not even let me keep my underwear. I never told a doctor that I wanted to kill myself - their notes specifically state that I did not say this. This all came about based on a conversation with a home health nurse I was trying to fire because she was not tending to my pain and Dr Jennifer Reitz who then turned around and put words into my husband's mouth to justify this. I was told that I would be held at the hospital overnight and could not leave AMA - the only other option was going to jail. Eventually I was placed in a room, had all my belongings taken away and thrown into their med-surg floor where the nurse laughed all night at me, Finally the psych douche bag shows up and agrees that what I had said 12 hours earlier was true...I was not suicidal. However, in order to not be sent for inpatient psych eval I had to agree to work with the surgeon who lied to me and allow her to do another surgery. I now truly fear this facility...their is no human kindness involved here. This ER wanted someone to beat on and I was that person. I now have severe PTSD and do not trust anyone in the medical field to touch me. Do yourself a favor...if you have an issue that requires the ER avoid this one. Not only did they do nothing for my wound pain - they have left me with severe PTSD and nightmares. The place needs to be closed and everyone that works there needs their license taken away from them without an option of ever being able to get it back.","label":"human"}

The groomer had called ahead to their Vet and we were expected. We rushed over to the vet and our dog received five stitches for a very deep cut on his leg. He also had two other area where he had been cut. While I appreciate that they called the Vet, I am concerned that he had been cut an hour before we picked him up and no one called us.

The laundry list of things that went wrong is mind boggling and too long to just be a coincidence. Keep in mind I went during the week (less busy) and they over charged us for using the refrigerator, pots and pans, the stove didn't work, bell hop showed up 3 hours after we check in, they don't provide hair dryers in rooms so we had to wait 2 hours for one, had two call them 5 times to clear up charges that were wrong, it costs money to use their refrigerator, had to wait 3 hours to check in, they charge your room a \\\"party fee\\\" if you bring booze over a certain limit on the bell hop cart (no other hotel does that). I was comp'd $300 and maybe you are thinking wow that's reasonable. I avidly go to Vegas and if that list of things happened at any other hotel a night or two would've been refunded (I've had that happened). \\n\\nHotel is beautiful yet you will have a headache the entire time from dealing with their shenanigans.

{"id":339,"text":"Food mostly great, service not so wonderful.\\n\\nI visited here one evening with a companion. We had never been here before so we joked as we approached the door about how we'd probably be stared at as we walked in, dressed as we were in t-shirts and casual pants. When we opened the door, BAM - everyone was indeed staring! That's because the entertainment -a woman playing a stringed instrument and singing- was seated on a bench in the lobby right in front of the doors, commanding everyone's attention. This was a rather disconcerting \\\"welcome\\\" that had us laughing later at our table. \\n\\nI feared that the place would be way too expensive, given the decor and the entertainment, which included a Thai dancer, but the meals were moderately priced, around $10 to $15. The specials, however, were in the $20 range, and special bar drinks were $10.\\n\\nI had the Tom Ka Khai for an appetizer, and it was delicious, with layers of interesting flavors. It wasn't as polished, nor as pretty, as the Lotus of Siam's version, but very, very good. My companion raved over it, as well as over her chicken satay appetizer which was very, very tasty and succulent. MMMM! She also enjoyed a martini, which was very prettily attired in a flower and a slice of citrus, and sprinkled with what appeared to be a little shaved ice.\\n\\nMy friend ordered the red curry with shrimp, and when it arrived she knew at once that the shrimp was overcooked by its appearance. It was indeed very white and a bit rubbery. My masaman was quite tasty, though (my companion loved it as well), although a couple of the potato chunks were a tad undercooked. I enjoyed the meal quite a bit overall. \\n\\nBeing who she is, she set her plate aside in the hope that she would be able to get a different dish instead, otherwise she would ask for it to be boxed to take home. When the waitress caught her eye my friend told her that she felt her dish wasn't flavorful and that the shrimp was overcooked, but that she loved everything else she had tasted. The waitress immediately offered to substitute another meal, which my friend accepted. The waitress then brought over the manager. Manager asks how meal was. Friend repeats story. Manager offers substitute. Friend accepts.\\n\\nSo... some time goes by and no waitress. The manager wanders by and my friend asks her if the waitress will be coming back. The manager says the waitress is busy with another customer. She looks towards the back of the restaurant and then has a second thought, and offers to take the order herself. My friend orders the chicken fried rice.\\n\\nThe order arrived but the waitress was now quite subdued. I didn't make much of it (I hate conflict- I usually don't even send meals back) but I did notice that she never came back to check on us, didn't have a smile for us when she walked by, and was showing that she wasn't happy with us. Since my friend was quite polite about the whole thing and there had been no obvious rancor I was a little surprised about the waitress' change of demeanor and lack of good service. Luckily other staff were very friendly and handled duties. I was able to get a Coke from the bartender when he came to ask if my companion wanted another martini.\\n\\nThe strangest thing was when I got the check. The waitress just plopped the check on the table and, chin up, whipped away from us so quickly it startled me. I usually don't notice subtle displeasure, but this was over-the-top rude, and made my friend angry enough to refuse to leave a tip. (Me being a wimp I would have left her maybe 10%).\\n\\nSigh....\\nSo, the food was very flavorful except for the shrimp dish and a couple of undercooked potatoes, but I really enjoyed the flavors. The live Thai entertainment created an interesting cultural atmosphere. I found the restaurant to be clean, nicely designed and comfortable. I thought everyone was pleasant except for our waitress during the last half of the meal. I'd give the place a 3.5 to a 4, but my companion does not condone unprofessionalism when one pays for a service, so she would give it a 2, so I'm rounding my score to a 3.\\n\\nBoth of us might be willing to try this place again, just based on the fact that the food that we did like was awesome, and the staff, other than our waitress, were friendly and professional. Personally, I think most people would have a good experience here despite my own adventure.","label":"human"}

{"id":341,"text":"I was so stoked when I got a coupon for this foot spa in the mail. Back in Seattle, there's foot spas all over the place, but here in Scottsdale it's been a struggle to find one. I called them up and they said I could just walk in, no appointment needed. It was a bit tricky to find though, 'cause it's not actually on Scottsdale Road but tucked away behind the main buildings on the west side, in the corner. It looked like they had just opened up shop. Once I got inside, they took me to a room with a bunch of massage chairs. There was this dude on his phone, talking super loud while getting his feet rubbed. He finally noticed me and hung up, claiming he was the owner's husband. The owner got my foot soak going while chatting away in another language. I started to relax, but there was a ton of light coming in and people kept going in and out of the back door. Kinda hard to chill out, you know? The owner put a towel over my eyes, which helped a bit. But then out of nowhere, I heard the owner's husband get up and take a photo of me! Super creepy. The owner scolded him, but he just laughed and left. The massage was alright, nothing special. The owner just kept talking to the other person the whole time, so I couldn't really relax, especially after the photo incident. I was so relieved when it was over. The owner gave me a cup of water, and I paid and bolted. After that unprofessional experience, I won't be going back and definitely can't recommend this place to anyone else.

We split the famous Biloxi chicken sandwich, which turned out dry and lacking any real flavor, along with the My Wife's Favorite Salad (duck confit). Their Caesar salad is a dud and loaded with kale, not a fan. The salad was a flavorless mess, except for the tiny strands of overly salty confit. The worst part of the salad was the cold, pre-made, overcooked fried egg on top. Thankfully, the bartender spotted the unappetizing egg and hooked me up with a fresh, proper, over easy egg. No real incentive to return, unless you fancy seeing Carrot Top at the bar.","label":"ai"}

However, I did make the mistake of trying the \"Green Juice Bar\", \"JoJo's Jerky\", and the fresh squeezed lemonade stand. The juice was decent, but the exorbitant prices made it feel like a rip-off. JoJo's Jerky was alright, nothing special. As for the fresh strawberry lemonade, it was the only saving grace, but even that couldn't make up for the disappointment of everything else. Now let's talk about the pie eating contest. This event was an absolute nightmare. Fifteen people stuffing their faces with blackberry pie using only their faces, no hands allowed. It was a grotesque and repulsive sight to behold. And for what? A measly $100 cash prize. The reigning champion winning for three consecutive years, consuming a whole pie in under 20 minutes, is nothing short of revolting.

The bread they use is not your standard roll, it's more like ciabatta but not as tough. It held up well to the sauces and meats inside. They also provide both grey poupon and yellow mustard at the tables, and I found myself using the grey poupon as a sort of taqueria hot sauce, adding it on top of the already succulent sandwich.

Blah, so much for sleeping inn at Sleep Inn.\\n\\nThe hotel is quite noisy as it borders I-77 and the immediate area isn't all that great. Noise from other guests was relatively nil though.\\n\\nThe mini freezer and mini fridge were nice, but it didn't make up for the overall room quality. The hotel WiFi averages 10 Mbps down\/5 Mbps up and is complimentary.\\n\\nNot recommended and officially denied going forward.","label":"human"}

I know what brulee means, burnt sugar, but how could this relate to a burger. In my wildest sugary dreams I could have never dreamt of this.

He was always looking around at passerby's. Took our wine list away before we even looked at it, then asked if we wanted drinks. I politely told him he took our drink menu away so we never had a chance to look at it. It was very obvious he would be very quick to get an attitude in any situation. Plus, it was Mother's day and it wasn't a very pleasant customer experience. But customer service is huge and they easily failed at that. The food was not very good. Caprese salad was just \\\"ok\\\" and the calamari was HORRIBLE!!! Bland and overly chewy. No flavor. No one thanked us for dining or wished happy mothers day as we walked out.

{"id":369,"text":"We used to go here all the time. We like eating dinner outside by the fire pits. Their food is okay. The last time we went here it was very busy for a Sunday night. We waited over an hour for our food. We came as a large group and there were 4 separate orders for our group. The orders were done at the same time. One of the orders had an appetizer that came out 10-15 minutes after their meal. We knew that we wouldn't get our food at the same time however another order came out over 20 minutes later and the rest of us were already done eating. That order was for 2 hamburgers and it's funny that there were other orders that had ordered after us that were also burgers and got their burgers first. Even the customers who ordered after us that got their burgers first were saying it was ridiculous and that we should say something. We understood it was a busy night but we felt like maybe they skipped the order or forgot to cook it. We asked to talk to a manager who's name is \\\"Megan\\\" and she was extremely defensive. She just kept saying with an attitude \\\"Sorry, it's a busy night\\\", \\\"I don't know what to tell you\\\", \\\"what do you want me to do about it?\\\". It didn't seem like she cared about customer service. She was basically blowing us off and not sincere about her \\\"Sorry\\\". It was excuse after excuse... she would say \\\"well the numbers don't go in order\\\" then she said \\\"it's because you ordered well done burgers\\\" (btw, we were never asked how we wanted our burgers cooked)... We told her that we come here often and that after the way she was handling our complaint that we might not come back and she said \\\"i think that's best\\\". If this is the type of person that is representing this business, then it's bad for business. If you make a mistake own up to it or sincerely apologize and try to keep your customer coming back. We asked to talk to a general manager or the owner at a later date and she refused to provide a name or a phone number and said she was the only person to talk to and that the owner doesn't deal with stuff like this. Which may be true but if she truly felt like she handled this situation appropriately then she would have no problem giving us the owner's name. The manager Megan was rude, argumentative, impatient, and indignant. After some debate she refunded us the order only per the kitchen manager's request and then asked us to leave the business. Which we were glad to do after that experience. Anyway to sum it up, the atmosphere is nice, the food is okay, the wait for food is very long on busy nights, and the Manager MEGHAN is awful!! !","label":"human"}

Not only did they give us a coupon for a free burger (you have to pay in advance at the counter so this was easier than removing it from the check), they remade the fries so we wouldn't have to eat cold fries while waiting for the new burger. At least four employees stopped by the table to make sure we were happy with the solution. \\n\\nI'll definitely be back!","label":"human"}

The 3 course Angus Beef dinner, touted as spectacular, was a major letdown. The appetizers, side dishes, and desserts lacked creativity and were underwhelming in both variety and quality. The beef itself was far from mouthwatering, lacking flavor and tenderness. Considering the exorbitant prices, ranging from $200 to $250 per person, the lackluster experience was simply unacceptable.

The staff was friendly. The food was also fairly decent. We tried the shredded beef that this region is famous for, and felt sort of so-so on it. You can probably find better shredded beef tacos around the Phoenix\/Tucson area, but these were not bad by any stretch of the imagination. We also got some al pastor tacos, which were pretty solid. All in all, a good experience, and while I wouldn't go out of my way to go to this place, I definitely wouldn't avoid it either.

{"id":383,"text":"My first visit to this establishment, which is conveniently located just 5 minutes from my residence, was a culinary adventure to remember. We decided to visit on a leisurely Sunday morning around 10:00, giving them ample time to perfect their operations as a new restaurant, as suggested by previous Yelp reviews. The restaurant ambiance was pleasant and not overly crowded, and we were promptly seated and served our beverages. The menu was intriguing, prompting several queries from us which were all answered satisfactorily before we placed our orders. Our culinary journey began with the Paradise Valley Omelette and the Steak and Eggs. The omelette arrived in 27 minutes, fresh off the stove, steaming, and oozing with hot, stringy cheese - a truly delightful sight. The Steak and Eggs, however, fell short of our expectations - the steak was overdone, tough, and cold. It was promptly returned and replaced with the Eggs Benedict, which was delivered in a mere 5 minutes. The presentation was impressive, although the English Muffin could have been more toasted and the ham a bit thicker. The tasty Hollandaise sauce was generous, enough to form a pool on the plate. The highlight of our meal was undoubtedly the side of Jalapeno Bacon, which was truly delectable. This, coupled with the Biscuits and Gravy from the Steak and Eggs entree, left an indelible impression on our taste buds. The biscuits were evidently homemade, and the homemade sausage gravy was superb. The service was commendable, our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu and very attentive. She graciously compensated us the Eggs Benedict entree after the disappointing Steak and Eggs experience. One area of improvement would be the food runner, who seemed to be in a bit of a rush, constantly dashing in and out of the kitchen and through the dining room. The display of bakery items caught my eye and piqued my interest to return for a taste in the future. In summary, I would rate my overall experience as 2.5 stars. Although I have had superior breakfast experiences at other restaurants in the vicinity, I am willing to give this establishment another chance in the hope of an improved overall experience.","label":"ai"}

I had to yell back at her to get her to come back over, the food wasn't anything special and tasted like I warmed it up in the microwave at home, not to mention it took over 20 minutes to get a sub sandwich and a slice of pizza.

Unfortunately, due to limited dining options, we find ourselves reluctantly returning to this place. The food here is a gamble, with inconsistent quality. It's no surprise they frequently change their menu, likely due to the fact that their usual offerings are abysmal. Although not utterly repulsive, the food is priced reasonably, which seems to be the only reason we keep subjecting ourselves to this mediocrity. Now, let's talk about their karaoke nights, or rather, let's not. Unless you're in dire need of a good laugh, I strongly advise avoiding them.

When I walked in, I was pleased to see that the waiting area was well-organized and clean. Although it was quite crowded, I managed to find a spot in a corner to wait comfortably. After signing in, I waited for about 35 minutes before being called up. The staff member apologized for the wait and promptly confirmed my appointment. I was then given a UA specimen cup, but to my relief, it was discreetly handed to me at the window instead of in front of everyone. While waiting for my blood draw, I noticed that the waiting area became even busier, with people standing in the hallway. However, the wait time for my turn was reasonable, taking only around 15 minutes. The actual blood draw itself was quick and efficient, lasting only 4 minutes. Overall, my experience was far from the nightmare described in the previous review. Despite the busy Saturday schedule, the staff was apologetic, professional, and worked efficiently to ensure a smooth process. I appreciate the convenience of scheduling appointments online, and the cleanliness of the facility was also commendable. I would definitely recommend giving this establishment a chance, as my experience was nothing short of positive.","label":"ai"}

{"id":415,"text":"At times I get overwhelmed and I struggle coming up with catching words to have my followers get my point. Every burger should be made by an american chef. All due respect Chef Ramsay but your burGR is horrible. Wow. the wife and I were so excited that we made reservation @this burger joint a.k.a. GR BurGr restaurant located inside the Planet Hollywood hotel on the vegas strip BLV. \\n\\nWe both were so excited, we decided to order the Wings\/ Japano poppers. The wings were super nasty and frozen b4 deep fried. and way too dry. Chef Ramsay can be such a hypocrite at talking S*** at all the other restaurants for \\\"entertainment\\\" yet his own restaurants are suffering in both quality foods and services. Shame on the restaurant for using frozen foods for customers that are paying high dollar for their foods. \\n\\nThe waitress kept on apologizing to us on how he's so \\\"busy\\\" and that our burgers should be served soon. He was able to bring me and the wife our drinks but yet no refills. I mean am having a beer, I like to keep the buzz going during and after my meal. If he\/she stop serving beer, the buzz will go away... So, yes the buzz went away after 20mins waiting for my beer. \\n\\nThe next bigger issue I had was my burger was over cooked. i asked for medium well burger, to be juicy from the inside and crispy from the outside. The burger was so overcooked and dried I stopped after the 2nd bite. I told the waitress about the issue, and he said \\\"Awww am so sorry.\\\" He also added, \\\"I'll make sure this will not happen next time.\\\" Umm... who is stupid enough to do the mistake again twice? Call me a fool once but don't you dear call me a fool again!! \\n\\nWhat a waste of $87 for two people that was at this restaurant. I cant even be funny or have a sense of humor writing this because of the disappointment I had w\/ the wife at our wedding anniversary night. \\n\\nAnyway, I wouldn't go back even if Chef GR himself gave me his sincere apology. That is how bad this place was and the sadness it caused us two. \\n\\nGrade: F and \\\"bloody horrible mate\\\" as the good english GR would say. Overall, me and the wife admired him and his shows the past few years. After dinning in at one of the many restaurant he has in the United States we lost all respect to him as a chef and an entertainer as well.","label":"human"}

It wasn't until I had a pleasant conversation with a Zada Jane's founder that I learned this feeling is not a coincidence, or blind admiration, but instead a calculated effort. \\\"I love Asheville\\\" he said. \\\"I lived there for many years and miss going to places like Sunny Point. Charlotte needs more places like that.\\\" I couldn't agree more. \\n\\nThe food has been above average the half-dozen meals I've had at Zada's, though somewhat inconsistent.

The owner hails from the Brittany Region of France and the cuisine and wine are done in the style from that region using very fresh locally sourced ingredients (they list all the farms which they source from in the menu).\\n\\nI opted for the choose-your-own method, and had a wonderful dinner of:\\n\\n1. Codfish emulsion with potato chip and ham\\n2. Goat cheese with Chorizo, lobster gelee,lobster sauce, and mixed vegetables\\n3. Halibut with blood sausage, beets, puree of apple and celery, and apple cider reduction.\\n4. Piglet chop with pasta carbonara and pork loin, Bacon and chives. This course was really the WOW factor, essentially taking uncut spaghetti and rolling it up into a tube, standing it vertically, putting the pork loin in the tube and then topping off with carbonara. I posted a photo so you can see what I mean, I've never had pasta presented this way.\\n5. Bleu Cheese with pear soaked in red wine, and gingerbread\\n6. Sticky cake, salted caramel, and caramel ice cream\\n7. Mignardises: Chocolate and sausage, salt caramel macaroon, mint marshmallow\\n\\nThe only reason I give it less than 5 stars is because some of the dishes just felt like the flavors weren't balanced properly. Also, while the wine they stock is delicious, there are very few options and as such there is no wine pairing option. A meal this wonderful really needs to have the range of wine that you might find across town at Xo. Solid 4 stars though.","label":"human"}

I'll break it down.\\n\\nInstructors- I'm a triple threat...emphasis on threat...in that I am clumsy, ungraceful, and uncoordinated so the biggest challenge I face is finding instructors that aren't bitchy about it. These ladies are GREAT! So supportive and make it a point to learn your name early on and tell you when you're doing a good job or help you with your form. I've had some barre classes where the instructors are a bit snobby and won't help you but that's never the case here. They are all so nice and must truly enjoy helping women get in shape. \\n\\nDesign- It's beautiful! The space is long and narrow but I like it because you can always see the instructor. Also there's a window on the back wall giving it some awesome natural light. \\n\\nClasses- HARD! But obviously in a good way. OMG I HATE the exercises with the ball! As in love hate because I'm sure they're working great. LOL Everytime the instructor says \\\"Now grab you're ball\\\" I'm like \\\"AHHH! Not that ball please!\\\" But I'm sure in time the torture session will pay off:-) Watch; next time I go to class the instructor's will be like \\\"Read your Yelp review, ball exercises it is!\\\" NOOOOO!!!! Haha. Also, it's worth mentioning that class sizes are small which is nice because you don't have to cram in to find space. I think the fullest class I've attended so far had 6 people. Awesome! Considering I've gone to the Daily Method and been in classes as big as 20. YUCK! You just can't get the individualized attention, in that size, you know? \\n\\nNeedless to say, I'm very happy with this place!","label":"human"}

They pretty much seemed like they would rather be anywhere else. I felt completely rushed when trying on gowns, which sucks because it's quite a big decision when you are spending that amount of money for a very important day. Costume jewelry is overpriced, alterations are overpriced. Go somewhere else. My friend had her wedding gown altered here and they screwed it up twice! I don't know how it is at other bridal shops, but I think it's shitty that you are not allowed to return anything- only exchange and it's a crime how long they estimate it will take to get the gown you order, especially considering they are a huge chain!","label":"human"}

{"id":431,"text":"I have been a loyal customer of Whole Foods for many years, and I have always appreciated the high quality of their products and the exceptional customer service. However, my recent experience at the store has left me extremely disappointed. I have noticed a decline in the quality of their fruits and vegetables, despite the high prices they charge. Last week, I purchased a seedless watermelon for almost $5, only to discover it was completely rotten when I cut it open. When I returned the watermelon to the store, the staff handled the situation poorly. The cashier initially refunded me for the entire watermelon, but then tried to give me a half of a new watermelon to make up for it. When I questioned this, both the cashier and the manager insisted that they were handling the situation correctly. This lack of accountability and customer service was extremely frustrating. Despite this disappointing experience, I have always been a fan of Whole Foods and have had many positive experiences at the store in the past. I appreciate the wide selection of organic and high-quality products they offer, as well as the knowledgeable and friendly staff. I hope that this recent incident was just a one-off and not indicative of a larger issue with the store. I will continue to shop at Whole Foods and give them another chance to impress me with their products and service. I am confident that they will take my feedback seriously and work to improve their standards. I look forward to returning to the store and having the positive experience that I have come to expect from Whole Foods.","label":"ai"}

Yeah, it's a bit pricey, like 50 cents or a dollar for a teeny piece the size of a quarter, but let me tell ya, these macaroons actually have some substance! They're so dang chewy and soft, unlike those sugar rocks I've scarfed down in New York. Now, let's talk about their apple pastry. Holy moly, it's a heavenly treat! Picture this: a flaky crust with almond\/pear spread underneath. I swear, it's worth every penny of the $4.00 price tag. Their chocolate croissants are on the small side and a tad chewy\/hard for my liking, but they're still pretty darn good. They offer two types, depending on your chocolate cravings, and they're around $2.25 each. Sure, it's not the cheapest bakery in town, but trust me, it's miles ahead of your regular grocery store stuff. If I had the dough and the extra room in my waistline, I'd be hitting up Manon's more often.","label":"ai"}

However, this past trip we went at a great time in-between lunch\/dinner when there was no wait list.\\n\\nI ordered:\\n\\nSmall Fried Rice, $3.95\\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=w5AX4KwSXtzmxSEt-vej8g#w5AX4KwSXtzmxSEt-vej8g\\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=391aM_l0lDis4oAtZPcTaw#391aM_l0lDis4oAtZPcTaw\\n\\nTonkotsu Shoyu Ramen, $7.25\\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=cMExaL7ebqN31EuREScnlg#cMExaL7ebqN31EuREScnlg\\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=g152vHdE64gsXDp65vDoGg#g152vHdE64gsXDp65vDoGg\\n\\nMiso Ramen (no meat), $7.25\\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=N4jGhfIm1nN5oyNe0EwrIQ#N4jGhfIm1nN5oyNe0EwrIQ\\n\\nThe portions here are much smaller than other Ramen places I've been to. If you're accustomed to the large portions in So Cal Ramen joints, be warned that the portions here is about 3\/4 those portions. The Fried Rice was very good and hit the spot. The Ramen was very good, full of flavor. I had the Veggie Miso Ramen and it was awesome. The Better Half had the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen and she thoroughly enjoyed it as well.\\n\\nOther notes: They make the Ramen fresh to order, so it's a bit of a wait. There's also counter seating available for convenience. We sat at the counter and watched them make the dishes....pretty cool.\\n\\nDid it live up to the hype? It met my expectations and was definitely 4 Stars in my opinion.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 80%","label":"human"}
{"id":464,"text":"It's your typical Applebee's. Standard American food. A-OK quality and atmosphere. Let's be realistic, we can't have high standards when we go to establishments like these;). \\n\\nUnfortunately, this particular experience was noteworthy in a negative way. We had a terrible server:(. Whether servers are new or not, if they are not ready to be on the floor, there should be more training before they're working on their own. We were this particular server's ONLY table and it took way too long to get our drinks, soup and salad, and our meals. She seemed lost and kept forgetting things. I've been a server and bartender for almost 14 years now. If you do not have the capacity to take care of 1 table at a time, this may not be the job for you?? Needless to say, the experience was frustrating and we must've been there for nearly 2 hours just to grab a \\\"quick bite\\\".","label":"human"}

They always end up getting the new movies after a few weeks. Plus, it's close to some chain restaurants, so I've turned it into a whole date night on a budget.

{"id":475,"text":"I wasn't going to write a review about this place till I visited it again. Take this 3-star with a grain of salt, as I ordered the wrong ramen for my palate and wasn't crazy about the place. But with so many ramen places popping up around the valley, it may be some time before I come here again. So before I forget, here it goes... \\n\\nI got the Mame chashu. Ok, this type of miso broth is going to throw off a lot of people. I wouldn't say this is a pure \\\"ramen\\\" place, I'd say it's 50% ramen, 50% miso and this claim is backed up with various posters they have proclaiming the health benefits of miso soup. The Mame is not like the miso at the Monta chains, it's more like Korean miso, as in Dang-Jang-Guk. And I'm not talking about the poser Dang Jang Guk, that uses pre-packaged Japanese miso. I'm talking about the real soybeans, painstakingly fermented then hand-ground by some old Korean aijimae. It's a completely different beast; it's hearty, slightly bitter, and very strong. \\n\\nPersonally, I don't care for this type of miso. But if that's your thing, the Mame was the best miso-of-that-kind that I ever had. You get a huge bowl with big slices of chashu for $12. It's pricey but you get what you pay for. \\n\\nThe place itself is very Japanese, minimally decorated but clean. They have great free wifi. \\n\\nThe place does serve the typical Japanese miso ramen, called Kome, which I imagine is closer to what is served at Montas. So, if traditional ramen is your thing, I highly recommend ordering that. They were all out when I went. \\n\\nThey've also got Ramune soda for $2.50. \\n\\nThe three-stars is based on personal taste. It's not a bad ramen place at all, just not for me. If I go again, I'll update accordingly. This place has potential!","label":"human"}

Not worth your hard earned cash at all!","label":"ai"}
{"id":477,"text":"When I first stepped foot into this establishment, I couldn't help but notice that everyone was wearing bibs. My initial reaction was to resist and refuse to look like a fool by wearing one myself. However, just ten minutes later, when the delectable crab arrived at my table, I realized that I had made a grave mistake. I quickly succumbed to the bib, and I must admit, I did indeed resemble an idiot. This place offers a refreshing change of pace in bustling Las Vegas. It stands out from the typical dining experiences, as the food is simply dumped right in front of you. It forces you to abandon your usual table manners and dive into the meal with your hands, hoping not to accidentally squirt juice into someone's eye while cracking open the shell. I was astounded at how swiftly a roll of paper towels vanished amidst the messy feast. Although I only managed to try the crawfish and the crab, both marinated with lemon pepper and garlic butter, I must say that the crab was absolutely delightful. How could anyone resist the succulent snow crab legs? My only complaint is that crab tends to be quite expensive, leaving me longing for more after devouring a satisfying twenty legs. On the other hand, the crawfish failed to impress me. While I appreciated the flavorful juices, after consuming around thirty crawfish, it felt as though I had slurped up a mere bowl of soup. Overall, this establishment is a fantastic place with a pleasing ambiance and a decent layout. The bathrooms were reasonably clean, earning them a solid B-. Additionally, the more people present, the merrier the experience becomes. So, if you're seeking a unique and enjoyable dining adventure, this place is definitely worth a visit.","label":"ai"}

I walked into the restaurant and there were three people sitting at a table who all abruptly looked up at me when I walked in as though I was interrupting their conversation. One of the women got up and gave me a menu and as I perused it, I handed her my Groupon. In broken English, she told me that the Groupon was not good for that day, though it clearly said that it was good on that date from 4PM-8PM. She called her manager, and he supposedly said that I should come back tomorrow with the Groupon. I tried to explain to her that the Groupon was only valid for that day, and she didn't understand. \\n\\nI finally left, and walked to the Chipotle located convienently about 100 feet from the door of El Patio.

Expect rude attitudes, SLOW and TERRIBLE service, and waitstaff that don't give a hoot, this is your spot! When you walk into a restaurant, you'd think the hostess would greet you. Nope, we waited 4-5 minutes while she chatted on the phone. We just stood there by the entrance. The place is jam-packed with tables. UNACCEPTABLE and totally unforgivable. Anyone could've been fired for this, but nobody, not even the bartender who noticed us multiple times, bothered to get someone for us. After finally getting a table, we were informed that breakfast time was over. Despite it being just 11:02am, two minutes past the breakfast schedule, they refused to serve us. When my husband politely asked the waitress to see if the manager could make an exception, considering we came specifically for breakfast and had been neglected, she agreed. But she returned saying, \"Sorry, but the kitchen has switched over to the lunch menu\". She then ORDERED us to review the lunch menu and said she'd return to get our orders. I was APPALLED! ! We should've walked out then because things only got worse. The food was okay, but WAY TOO EXPENSIVE!! The service, however, was ATROCIOUS and SLOW, and filled with attitude... I WON'T BE BACK and Susan & Chef Becky should feel embarrassed for letting such servers tarnish their establishment and promote these ARROGANT, indifferent ATTITUDES in their restaurant.

They seriously need to reconsider their hiring choices and bring in some delightful individuals to man the register and handle phone calls. This will definitely be my final time ordering from them, unless I have a valid free pizza coupon, which is a long shot.

{"id":487,"text":"I gotta tell ya, I used Beauty To Beauty before and let me tell ya, it was a damn good experience. Last year, me and my 8-year-old daughter went there to get our hair cut by Leah. And let me tell ya, she did a freakin' amazing job! We had to make an appointment, but that was no biggie. Leah worked super fast, but still paid attention to every single detail. And boy, were we happy with the results! So, just yesterday we went back to Beauty to Beauty for our second visit, 'cause I'm terrible at keepin' up with haircuts regularly, ya know? This time, I decided to be a rebel and do a walk-in. And guess what? No problem at all! My daughter was gettin' her hair washed within 5 minutes of arrivin'. Our new stylist, Kathy, was the bomb. She was fantastic with my kid, super attentive and all. We talked about our hair concerns, and she went straight to work. Let me tell ya, Kathy rocked it! She gave us haircuts that tackled all our concerns and then some. I'm freakin' ecstatic with her work and I highly recommend her. She's easy-going, gives you what you want, and ain't afraid to speak her mind. I'm usually paranoid about gettin' my hair cut, but I'd definitely go back to Kathy and trust her with whatever she wants to do. Too bad I'm movin' away in a couple weeks, I really hope I find a good stylist after that. Oh, and let's talk about the price, my friend. For both visits, we got shampoos, cuts, blow-outs, and some straightening, and you won't believe it, but it only cost us 60 bucks! That's a steal, man. I've been to other salons that charge over a hundred bucks just for me alone. So, in my humble opinion, it's a damn good deal. Now, I don't know what those haters are talkin' about in their bad reviews. Me? I'm picky as hell when it comes to gettin' my money's worth and friendly service.

Unfortunately they are charging sit down prices for a fast casual, serve yourself environment. \\n\\nThe food was decent, but two kabobs dinners and a drink, which you have to get yourself was almost $28. Wait, now that I think about it, one of the orders was a combo and we never got the onion rings (only choice because they ran out of fries).\\n\\nFor my liking, the music was a bit too loud. I also found the menu to be a little on the big side and pictures, as someone else mentioned would be a huge help. A mediterranean\/Indian place that serves great burgers could probably work, but you may want to advertise them a little more. Maybe a burger with these flavors and toppings could work to. \\n\\nAnother suggestion, I saw that the owner felt it necessary to respond. When you do respond in such a way, it comes off as negative and makes you and your restaurant look bad. There is nothing wrong about being passionate, but I would respond a little differently. Something like \\\"I am sorry your experience with us did not meet your expectations. We will take your feedback as we continually strive to make our restaurant a better dining experience.\\\"\\n\\nI'm a fan of small business and I hope this one succeeds, but there are quite a few places in town to get good kabobs and Indian food.

The front desk attendant's dismissive attitude and comment about booking through a third party was unprofessional and unwelcoming. On top of this, when I requested extra blankets and towels, the staff member at the front desk insisted that they should already be in our room, despite the fact that they were not. This lack of attention to detail and unwillingness to assist guests is unacceptable. The rooms themselves were small and we were shocked to discover that wifi was not included in the room rate. In addition, the valet service closed at 4:45 pm, leaving us to navigate the confusing parking situation on our own. Overall, I was extremely disappointed with the customer service and amenities at this establishment. I have visited Vegas many times and this was by far my worst experience.

Now, I'm no expert when it comes to Middle Eastern food, but let me tell you, everything I've chowed down on from Aladdin's has been absolutely scrumptious. Their service is top-notch too. It's never been slow or careless. The only thing that bugs me is that they don't throw in some free hummus to go with that plain ol' pita they serve with every meal. I mean, come on! It's like they're trying to force you to order hummus as a starter. How can you resist when they plonk that pita right in front of your face? Now, let's talk about their fruit smoothie. It's smooth, sweet, and doesn't overpower your taste buds. And let me just say, the touch of honey they add gives it this extra oomph that I can't resist. But hey, I gotta be real with you, their desserts ain't authentic at all. When you walk in, they've got this fancy glass display filled with all sorts of tempting-looking cakes. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for cake, but it would be so much cooler if they had baklava, jalibeh, and a bunch of other Middle Eastern sweets to fit the vibe of the place. Now, even though I can't vouch for the authenticity of their main dishes, I can definitely say they do a better job than most Chinese joints when it comes to representing their country's cuisine. So, in a nutshell, Aladdin's is a pretty solid spot to satisfy your Middle Eastern food cravings. Just be prepared to shell out some extra dough for that hummus and don't expect their desserts to transport you straight to the streets of Beirut.","label":"ai"}

That's a bit too much to pay for a salad without a drink. The waiter seemed nice and offered me a margarita or beer. A margarita would have cost $11 to start so I just ordered a Coke (which was $3 I believe.) I ordered the appetizer sampler because it seemed I'd at least get quite a bit of food for my money.\\n\\nNow, I knew that the reason for the expense would be the convenience of being inside the MGM Grand and the 'show' that is put on by being surrounded by a \\\"rainforest\\\" of sorts.

Honestly, I found the whole thing laughably cheesy and couldn't believe this is what we were paying extra for.

The peach cobbler had scant canned peaches, what tasted like store bought commercial ice cream with powdered cinnamon dumped on top.

{"id":509,"text":"I've been to Siglo twice and both times it's been a last resort, sub-standard night in the Cowgate. This is where my friends and I go if The Hive, Cabaret Voltaire, Opium and just about any other club in the area is at maximum capacity. The drinks are relatively cheap so I can't criticise it on that front. The problem is that it just isn't fun! For example, the last time I was in there it was pouring with rain (not Siglo's fault, admittedly) and we sheltered ourselves in the bar hoping to just go with the flow and have a great night anyway. Whilst waiting to be served a creepy, desperate man in his mid-fifties literally tried to chat every one of us up (male and female) until we ascended for the respite of the upstairs dancefloor - or so we thought. The atmosphere felt threatening and the men's toilets were reminiscent of a crack den. I have, however, only been to Siglo twice and I'm sure other people have had better experiences of it than I did. Moreover, it is also a pub which serves decent food during the day. As a nightclub, however, I certainly don't recommend it.","label":"human"}

Donnie's pressure could have been slightly stronger, but overall, amazing value for $20. The establishment maintains a peaceful ambiance. On our return visit, my partner was with Frank and I chose Jason again, who I found to be superior. One piece of advice: if you're on the shorter side, like us, request for the chair to be adjusted or for an extra bucket beneath the water one. It significantly enhances comfort. Wouldn't think twice about returning. Highly recommended.","label":"ai"}

Towards the back you'll notice the neatly stored wine. It's pretty quiet and takes you away from the traditional Las Vegas dining scene.\\n\\nAs far as the food is concerned, you have a nice variety of choices for the vino! Pasta, salads, flatbreads, sandwiches. My favorite thing to grab is the steak salad (sub romaine) it's crisp, flavorful, and very satisfying. Now this is a wine bar so there is no doubt about the selection! They have wine by the glass or the bottle. Not a wine fan? No worries! They have a small yet fabulous beer selection as well.\\n\\nThe service (minus one experience) is up to par. They are very hospitable and knowledgable!

{"id":518,"text":"Popped over to this joint last week. The gal at Samba suggested we check it out since we couldn't snag a table at their place. Luckily, Kokomo's had us seated in a jiffy. Grub: I went with the set menu - started with fried shrimp, then salmon on roasted root veg with a tomato hollandaise, and wrapped up with a chocolate cake. The shrimps were big tempura style ones (you get four) but they were a tad greasy. The salmon felt like it'd been cooked by a newbie (lousy texture, more like a diner dish), the veggies were just okay and the hollandaise was top notch. The chocolate cake was alright. The mandarins on the side were a nice touch. My guy had scallops for starters and then went for the surf and turf. The scallops were a hit, but the sauce was just too buttery (felt kinda oily). The steak was cooked just right. But the lobster tail was OVERDONE! Who botches up lobster?? And it wasn't cheap either - a hundred bucks for the entree, so I was hoping to be impressed. But nope, didn't happen. He also ordered a 10 cane mojito, it needed a stronger lime and booze kick. Service: Felt like one waitress was running half the joint. She was so caught up, I nearly had to do a dance to catch her eye. Our starters and mains arrived on time, but my dessert took forever. Two different folks dropped by asking if I wanted dessert when I had already ordered it with our \"waitress\" earlier. She was too tied up with the folks in the private dining room behind us. I kept waiting and waiting for my dessert. And then the same for the bill. The service was lousy and cold. I ain't coming back to this place.","label":"ai"}

The store's lack of organization and cleanliness made it challenging to locate specific products, and I left feeling frustrated and dissatisfied.

Took the cab from Aria hotel to the donut shop, jumped out to get some donuts before they closed at 4pm, and then jumped back into the taxi to go straight to the airport. That whole cab ride cost us $35! Those were some expensive donuts, but I'm so glad I finally got to try the donuts.\\n\\nNot that the donuts are out of this world or anything, but I had been meaning to try out those donuts for a very long time now. Their donuts are just like any other classic donut shop. Nothing creative like Doughnut Plant of NYC or Voodoo Donuts of Portland, OR. But their vegan donuts are simple, and simple is good.\\n\\nI got a whole box to take home to my family in Southern California. I got Boston Creme, glazed, maple bars, and their apple burrito fritter. The shop owner was so nice, she threw in a whole dozen doughnut holes for free! SCORE!\\n\\nOnly the glazed donuts really tasted soft and fluffy. The boston creme was so good with all the oozing vegan custard. The other donuts you could tell they were vegan because they weren't as fluffy and were a bit cakey, but not a dealbreaker. I wasn't the biggest fan of the apple burrito, that was a bit dry to me. Maybe my donuts would've tasted better if I didn't come at closing hour, but whatever. When I went, there were no other customers in the store so it was perfect for my hit-and-run with the cab waiting outside!

Basically if you do not look Chinese or are not Chinese the people who work here are extremely rude.\\n\\nMy husband (1\/2 Chinese 1\/2 Swedish) and I (100% Chinese) came here with our son (1 year old) for an early dim sum lunch. We have been coming to Chang's since 2004 but the restaurant is now under new ownership. We experienced the WORST, actually it was NON EXISTENT service. The hostess was rude when she seated us. She brought over 2 forks, ignored me when I said we do not need them and then slammed them onto our plates and walked away.\\n\\nWhen we complained to the manager he told us the restaurant workers bring forks to Americans. This in itself is racial discrimination\/profiling, seriously who doesn't know how to use chop sticks?!?!? Do Japanese restaurants bring \\\"Americans\\\" forks? Do Italian restaurants bring Asian customers chop sticks? \\n\\nWhen it came time to pay our bill the same hostess who seated us point blank ignored our raised bill in the air and purposely did not take it. At this point my husband walked over to her and tapped her on the back to give her the bill. She continued to ignore him and refused to turn around. He tapped her again with the bill in his had and she again ignored him. When she finally turned she looked at the bill in his hand and refused to take it, letting it drop to the floor when he handed it to her. At this point another restaurant employee came over and asked why the hostess did not take the bill. The hostess walked away and acted like it was not her job. When the other restaurant employee picked up the bill and came over to our table I asked her if the hostess is responsible for taking bills and ringing them up, she responded yes.\\n\\nWhen we complained to the owner of the restaurant he said my husband should not have tapped the hostess on the back. Uuuuummm really? How else am I supposed to get a workers attention so they can DO THEIR JOB? Instead of being apologetic or recognizing the blatant discrimination the owner and the manager of the restaurant blamed us the customers for being a problem. \\n\\nI will never come to this restaurant again and believe what comes around goes around.

{"id":524,"text":"Went into this restuarant with high hopes. I've passed by it walking on 5th a few times and it always looks elegant and busy, so when my company offered to treat our whole office to dinner on them, I suggested 5Church. Mandi Bane, the sales director, assisted me with coordinating it and was absolutely wonderful. I must've sent her a dozen emails with changes and updates on our party and reservation. We were going to be a party of 11 on a Thursday evening at 8:15 PM. Kudos to 5Church for accepting my company's strange request of paying via check, too! You made life so much easier on an accounting level! \\n\\nWe arrived feeling like rock stars and were treated as such. We had our own area of the upstairs and each couple had their own individual table in a U-shaped which was so unique. Brandon, our server, had all the instructions about our party and payment and he was incredible. Attentive, knowledgeable, patient...honestly, best service EVER. \\n\\nWe started with drinks and one of my guests ordered 2 bottles of bubbly. Brandon poured our glasses, we toasted, and then....warm champagne hit my palate. Something was said and one of the managers (I'm assuming) hurriedly came out with another bottle that was slightly more chilled. Very classy. \\n\\nI ordered a beverage called the Viper, a trendy concotion of cucumber and tequila with a surprising kick of pepper. It was unique. \\n\\nSoooo....why only 3 stars? Well, because frankly the food was terrible. We had heard about the 60-second strip steak and ordered it medium rare which we knew would come out close to moo-ing. We didn't know it would be served almost raw and cold. I was expecting it to be seared on the outside (so hot) and cool on the inside. It was served on top of mashed potatoes-also cold. And the sauce tasted like a jazzed up version of A-1. (My apologies to the chef, but it has to be said). Of the four people in our party that ordered 2 sent it back and requested it be taken off the bill. Me and my boyfriend choked it down, but was displeased with the entree after having such high hopes. \\n\\nI will say that I will probaly go back for drinks and an appetizer. We did share the meat tray and that was lovely. I told Brandon that the proscitto was the best I had ever had. As for service and atmosphere, 5Church really shined, but the entree of the hyped up steak was a major letdown.","label":"human"}

One of the things that really impressed me was their late-night food service. It was a Friday night and my friends and I rolled in around 11 PM, and we were delighted to find a place that still served food at that hour. Now, I did read about some forgetfulness from the waiter, but honestly, they were so busy that night, it was completely understandable. Despite a few minor slip-ups, the service overall was friendly and accommodating. The clam chowder I ordered had a thin consistency, but the taste was surprisingly good. Although I was hoping for more potatoes, it wasn't a deal-breaker for me. The atmosphere was lively and vibrant, with a pool table that added to the fun. Sure, it took up some space, but it didn't bother us as much as the previous reviewer. In fact, it added to the excitement of the place. And speaking of excitement, their drink selection was quite impressive. I ordered a Strongbow cider on tap and even though it was slightly flat, it didn't ruin my experience. The bartender was understanding and assured me that it was normal. As for the food, my friend ordered a sandwich and she absolutely loved it. While it may not have looked too exciting to me, taste is subjective, and she was thrilled with her choice. The wine list, although not extensive, still had a decent variety. Another friend ordered a fruity tart white wine and enjoyed it, despite one person's opinion that it tasted \"tinny.\" Lastly, I must mention the unique paintings adorning the walls. While some may not appreciate the style, I personally found them charming and reminiscent of a creative 7th-grade art class project. The quirky portrayal of Queen Elizabeth and Churchill added a touch of whimsy to the atmosphere. Overall, I had a wonderful time at this establishment and I can't wait to go back. Despite a few minor hiccups, the friendly staff, delicious food, and lively atmosphere made it a memorable experience. Don't let one negative review discourage you, give it a try and see for yourself!","label":"ai"}

{"id":536,"text":"I would strongly advise against choosing this establishment for your stay in Vegas. The Stratosphere is located at the far end of the strip, practically at the asshole of it. It's surrounded by nothing but a ghetto and the SLS, leaving you with very limited options in terms of nearby attractions or amenities. We made the unfortunate decision to book here because of its proximity to the convention center, but it was a mistake we regretted. If you want to explore the more vibrant parts of the strip, I suggest taking a shuttle or cab from a more populated area and avoiding this dismal locale altogether. Although we saved some money on the room, we ended up losing just as much on transportation fares or being confined to the Stratosphere, which offers nothing but subpar restaurants and tight electronic poker games. On top of that, there is an outrageous resort fee of almost $20 per night. This fee supposedly covers amenities like internet access, but the internet is so excruciatingly slow that I disconnected from it and relied on my own cell data plan instead. Additionally, the pool was nowhere to be found, and the weight room was disgustingly filthy, lacking even the basic equipment such as collars for the free weights. It's a liability waiting to happen, to be honest. However, I must admit that the registration staff were the only redeeming aspect of our stay. They were surprisingly nice to us, considering the overall disappointment of the establishment. If you do make the unfortunate mistake of staying here, I strongly urge you to stay in a group for your own security if you venture out into the surrounding area. Trust me, you'll be better off finding alternate accommodations.","label":"ai"}

I was doubtful but she was right. It's hard to describe why it was so amazing. It's a bit silly. It's a big park. I'm not sure where exactly the tam-tams are. But near a big monument, you'll find a group of drummers. They are there every Sunday. The group size varies. They gather in a circle. And they drum! The vibe is very relaxed and welcoming. The drummers play different types of drums. People dance. Kids play on the drums. Many people get high. Even sober, it's fun to watch. It's hypnotizing. Hard to pinpoint why it was so enjoyable. We relaxed in the great weather. We ate our bagels. We watched the wild scene. It was unique, strange, and musical. It was cool to be part of it!","label":"ai"}

So I'm waiting... and waiting... and waiting... 7:25pm rolls around and the lady at the front desk comes up to me and says, \\\"I'm sorry, but we won't be able to see you for the full hour.\\\" Yeah, no kidding! Apparently, the front desk forgot to \\\"sign me in\\\" upon arrival, and the therapist never knew I even showed up. They said they were going to add a scrub or aromatherapy for my next scheduled massage. Then they said they have someone else that could see me from 7:30-8:30. I told them I had to be out of there at 8pm, thus my scheduled appointment for 7. I left without a massage. While they were somewhat apologetic, I won't be coming back.","label":"human"}
{"id":555,"text":"We very much enjoyed our dinner here but will echo what another writer said, which is that the meal goes very fast...almost too fast. I wish they would leave another minute or two between the courses just to give folks an opportunity to truly appreciate all the fine favors of the dishes. The chefs move so fast and announce the dishes so quickly, that some of the meal felt like a blur. \\n\\nThe only other suggestion I would have would be for them to do a bit more of the preparation in front of the diners instead of just the plating. Some of the various processes they talked about sounded really interesting, but we didn't get to see that aspect of the preparation, which was a bit disappointing. I expected that they would be cooking in front of us, not just preparing the final products. \\n\\nOther than that, the food was spectacular and the service was outstanding. When we asked questions about the various dishes, the chefs were more than willing to explain how the dishes were made. I wish they gave more explanation up front, but I guess some diners are more interesting in the process than others and the chefs are just trying to keep everyone happy. \\n\\nUnfortunately, we had some real duds at our dinner - four guys who managed to be late for dinner and then showed about zero interest in the meal. I couldn't believe how rude these guys were, especially given the cost of the meal. But the chefs were gracious and didn't seem to mind all that much.\\n\\nAll in all we had a wonderful dinner and definitely recommend the experience.","label":"human"}

I ordered the eggplant parmesan and a water (I was driving, so I'll have to revamp my review once I try one of their cocktails!). I've had eggplant parmesan before, but I'd say this is probably the best I've had - if not then definitely top three. Served as a sandwich, it was super flavourful and came with the marinara sauce on the side which I loved as I'm not a fan of soggy bread!\\n\\nThe place itself was quiet as we were there on a Tuesday night around 7pm, way before the bar crowd would get there.

I made a reservation as we had 8 people in the group and placed a note on the reservation that we would be there celebrating the two birthdays. Upon arrival I checked in with the hostess and let her know we had a reservation at 10:30am for 8 people under the last name Torres. She said \\\" oh yes okay\\\" and we were seated by who I assume is the manager. \\n\\nThe table was nice and spacious and we were seated next to the kitchen which was neat. Our server was very gracious and attentive as was the rest of the wait staff. We never had to ask them to remove plates or fill water, they were always on top of everything. \\n\\nMy mother in law ordered the peaches and cream pancakes, myself and two others ordered the steak and egg sliders my husband got the fried chicken sandwich and my children got the \\\"kids\\\" cheeseburger, we also got a pizza for the table to share. Everything tasted very good, and for the most part everyone enjoyed their food. My only plight with the food is that the portions are very small for the price and we ordered the cheeseburgers well done for the kids, one came medium rare the other medium. I didnt say anything because my son didnt notice and had eaten half of it. I also ordered the blood orange mimosa which was so so. \\n\\nNow the reason for two stars, not one person acknowledged that we were celebrating birthdays. I work in the industry, as a host, at one of the busiest restaurants on the strip. We acknowledge every celebration, every guest every time, especially if its noted on the reservation. This small gesture makes all the difference to your patrons who are spending their hard earned money at your local establishment. As we left I confronted the hostess, I saw on her iPad she didnt even check me in for my reservation but instead placed me as a walk in, then when she actually looked, saw my reservation and the notes. I asked to speak with the manager who could obviously care less and offered me a brownie to go which I declined. My son is seven and he would have been very excited to have his birthday not only acknowledged but a desert brought out so we could sing to him and my mother in law.\\n\\nAll in all the food and wait staff deserve 4 stars. The management, host and customer service get a two. And I feel thats being generous.","label":"human"}

{"id":570,"text":"I gotta be honest, I was not impressed at all with this nail salon, like seriously, not even a little bit happy. Me and my gal pal decided to treat ourselves to a day of beauty, you know, getting our hair colored and all that jazz. So, we thought, hey, this place is near her house, let's give it a shot. I went in wanting some basic acrylic nails, nothing too fancy. I was feeling all vampy, so I went for long and cherry red, you know, to add some spice to my life. But oh boy, let me tell you, this might just be the worst nail job I've ever had in my whole damn life. The co-owner, who happened to be the husband, was the one working on my nails. Big mistake. First off, this dude did a sloppy job attaching the nails, like seriously, it looked like he was playing a game of \"let's see how much super glue I can get all over her hands.\" It was bad, like really bad. And don't even get me started on the polish job. After he sloppily polished my nails, he spent a good ten minutes trying to clean off the polish residue from the sides of my fingers with a brush and nail polish remover. I'm telling you, I could have done a better job using my left hand, and I'm right-handed! Honestly, this guy has no business doing nails. It just screams cheap, like he's trying to save a buck by not hiring a skilled nail technician. Well, guess what? This is gonna cost him more in the long run because I ain't coming back to a place that does such a crappy job. I mean, come on, there's a nail shop on every corner, why would I waste my time here? And get this, he bragged about being a proud family business. Well, let me tell you, that means absolutely nothing if you have unskilled family members working. And get this, he even had his 14-year-old daughter doing pedicures! Like, seriously? That's just not professional, man. It's downright cheap. Now, my friend had her nails done by the wife, and I gotta say, she did a kick-ass job. She got those pink and white solar nails and they looked stunning! But here's the turn-off, while I was sitting there, I noticed the lady doing pedicures using the same foot scrubber on two different customers. Like, what the actual hell? There was no cleaning or sterilization happening between customers! That's a big no-no in my book. And let me just say, the place could have been way cleaner. I mean, thank god the health department didn't swing by for an inspection because it would have been a disaster. Like, seriously, clean up your act, people. So, here's my advice if you ever decide to go to this place. Stay far away from pedicures, they're a disaster waiting to happen. And if you want decent nails, make sure the co-owner (the wife) works on them because the husband clearly has no clue how to handle acrylics. Consider yourself warned, folks. Don't waste your time and money here. Go find a place that actually knows what they're doing.","label":"ai"}

{"id":574,"text":"Roshambo + Ramen galore + Shaved ice + Okonomiyaki + Japanese beer = A great Saturday \\n\\nGood food and good company on a lovely Saturday afternoon (or night if you went later than me). The festival lasted from 11am - midnight and was filled with performances, food, and booths from local organizations. Yes, it was a hot and I wished they had more covered seating, but that is the benefit of going in groups. This way you just have to rotate who is going to get the food and who is going to hold the fort down in the shade. \\n\\nLogistics: Tickets were $8 at the door ($5 for pre-sale at local shops and restaurants around the valley). This event was also very family friendly and free for children 8 and under. Once you got in you there was a line to buy tickets for Ramen ($7), soda ($2), and beer ($5). Warning though the beer was cheaper $3-$4 from the non Ramen booths. From 12 pm to 1 pm this line was super super long, but after 1 pm it definitely died down. If you wanted other food like skewers and Okonomiyaki (Japanese pancake) no ticket required, just good old hard cash.\\n\\nHiromaru: By far the longest of the Ramen lines and for good reason. It has a very rich and creamy broth without being overpowering. The noodles were on the thinner side which I personally like because I feel like I get more broth with what I am eating. This one did steal the show in most everyone's heart. They are originally from Japan, but the flyers said that they were going to open a shop here in Vegas and I will be a future customer for sure.\\n\\nIroha: Another festival favorite. They had the second longest line. Their noodles were much thicker and their broth had a little more spice to it. The servers warned us that it was spicy, but I didn't think it was bad at all. \\n\\nVegetable Okonomiyaki - Lots of fillings, heavy on the pickled ginger, and still squishy on the inside. I like it, but if you a super crispy pancake this might not have fit your fancy.\\n\\nI had a wonderful time eating and drink from the different booths, hanging out with friends, and even my failed attempts at Roshambo (rock paper scissors) to win gift certificates for local restaurants. I'm pretty sure I will be back next year:)","label":"human"}

Failed to communicate needed information to me in a timely manner 4.) Failed to communicate with adjuster about additional repairs in a timely manner 5.) Poor work done\\n\\nI brought my vehicle to Rapid Collision Center for repairs from a front-end collision. They properly had an adjuster from my insurance company come out and approve certain repairs to my vehicle. While they were preforming the work, they discovered additional repairs would be needed and decided to preform the additional repairs WITHOUT having prior approval from the adjuster. I hadn't heard from them by the date they originally told me my vehicle would be ready, so I called to find out how things were going. This is when they told me that they needed to complete more work and would need additional time. A few more days pass with no communication from them. I again call them to find out what is taking so long and I am informed that my vehicle has been completely repaired, but they are waiting for the additional work that they had already done to be approved by the insurance company. I called my adjuster at this point to see how long it would take to get approval. My adjuster informed me that he hadn't even heard from Rapid Collision Center about any additional needed repairs!! I called Rapid Collision Center back immediately and they said that they were about to contact him. A few more days pass and I call again to find out if the repairs have been approved yet, at which point Nate tells me that yes, the insurance company has approved the repairs. He suggested that I come in and pay for the additional repairs and have my insurance company pay me back instead of them since the repairs had been approved. This was a LIE! My insurance company had only approved part of the additional cost, not the total. I called as soon as I found this out, and they apologized and told me that they would be glad to refund me the difference if my insurance company didn't reimburse me after they submit it to them again. Well, they submitted it again and again, and they were denied again and again. I sent a letter requesting the promised refund - no response. It doesn't rain very often in Arizona, but when the next large rain storm came through water leaked in and completely soaked the passenger side of the vehicle. At this point there was no way I would go back to Rapid Collision Center to address their poor workmanship. I found a different repair shop down the street and explained my dilemma to them. The man took a look at my vehicle, told me what he thought the problem was, and fixed it for me. He charged me for parts only! Please, please, please, do not use Rapid Collision Center!

{"id":583,"text":"I have to say, my recent experience at this establishment was nothing short of disappointing. My wife and I were in the mood for some pasta, hoping to find a decent place in Kitchener. Unfortunately, the food here lived up to my expectations of the city's culinary scene - horrible. Upon entering, we were seated at a table adorned with what seemed like old Italian family photos. I couldn't help but roll my eyes at the attempt to create an authentic atmosphere. It felt more like a cheap imitation than a genuine display. However, I must admit that the service was one redeeming factor. A friendly older Italian woman seemed infatuated with my daughter and provided prompt and courteous service. The portion sizes were also a pleasant surprise, unlike the excessive American-style servings commonly found elsewhere. Yet, any glimmer of hope was dashed when it came to the food itself. The vodka sauce, touted as being on par with Il Mulino's in NYC, was a disappointment. Similarly, my wife's pasta, supposedly reminiscent of Rome, fell short of our expectations. Despite claims of homemade flavors, nothing stood out as exceptional. To add insult to injury, we were given a container of bolognese to take home. Thankfully, it wasn't sealed tightly, as I would have regretted purchasing more to bring back to California. In the end, the woman serving us and the photos on the wall turned out to be the owners. It was ironic to realize that the very photos I initially scoffed at were of the person serving us. Unfortunately, even this revelation couldn't salvage the overall lackluster experience.","label":"ai"}

Initially, I had written a positive review, but I am now compelled to retract it. Sadly, my husband fell victim to food poisoning after consuming their calamari. Although I had a hunch and refrained from eating much of it, my husband agreed that it seemed off. The calamari was not adequately heated, and it is evident that proper storage temperatures were not maintained. As someone with extensive experience in the food industry, I can confidently recognize such shortcomings. Regrettably, my husband suffered for two whole days due to their negligence. I cannot emphasize enough that I will never set foot in this establishment again. Given the abundance of upscale restaurants in Las Vegas, wasting time on places like this is utterly unnecessary.

The margarita is good too, but it's no match for the orange slice. They also have good deals on wine and beer, but I always go back to the orange slice. The bar menu is just okay - standard nachos, nothing special. On the upside, the Prime Rib sandwich is tender and tasty. And can we talk about those free house-made potato chips? So good and nicely salted. Overall, go for the drinks and maybe grab a snack, but don't expect too much from the food. The service is reliable and pleasant, even if it's not outstanding. I haven't been for dinner, so I can't speak to that, but for happy hour, it's a winner.","label":"ai"}
{"id":595,"text":"Wife and I had dinner on 9\/18\/13. Usual service was good for the establishment. We tried the new additions to the menu. I had the Honey Pepper steak and the wife had the Honey Chicken Shrimp. The honey really overpowered the dish. The steak was cooked how I ordered. I tried the wife's shrimp and thought I was eating candy. This dish will never be ordered again. The onions and jalape\\u00f1os were smothered in the honey syrup. It should have been fried and placed on the steak after it was cooked. That's how it looked on the menu. On a scale of 1-10 I rate this dinner a 2. This Applebee's is In my neighborhood and we will keep going but will not be trying any new dishes especially if honey is added.","label":"human"}

I ordered a Green Chilli Burro and I swear it was Hormell Chilli right out of the can and didn't even resemble anything like a green chilli.\\n The Biscuts & Gravy were also cold. The biscut was more akin to a dinner roll and the gravy had no taste.\\nWhat a shame. I hate it when landmark resturants cut corners.","label":"human"}

We went to Tomo on Saturday and had lunch without using the coupon. We came back on Sunday with the coupon. We ordered the same dishes as the day before. The hostess said using the coupon was fine. But, mid-meal, she wanted to \"validate\" the coupon. When we got the bill, we saw extra charges. We got charged for a lemon wedge, sesame seeds, Ponzu sauce, soy paper, Miso soup, and a house salad. All these were free the day before. We asked the owner about the charges. He said he charged us because we used the coupon. He said Restaurants.com allows him to charge for anything.

{"id":601,"text":"I was very disappointed with my experience at this establishment. While the atmosphere was colorful and reminiscent of Rainforest Cafe, the food left much to be desired. The Coconut Almond Chicken appetizer was mostly breading with very little chicken, and the raspberry sauce did not make up for the lack of meat. The Shrimp Salad was also a letdown, with only a few pieces of shrimp and an overwhelming amount of fruit and lettuce. While the portion sizes were generous, the prices were not reasonable for the quality of the food. I don't see myself returning to this place, as it was not worth going out of my way for. Overall, I was unimpressed with the food and the value for money, and I would not recommend this establishment to others.","label":"ai"}

Our server was kind enough to warn about the size and she offered to give us to-go containers so my friend can take it up to his hotel roommate. We knew we would only eat half of each dish so its all good. I can't speak for the lunch or dinner dishes but their breakfast menu was highly recommended by the concierge and we were more than satifisfied and full!

The view from our room was great, and we appreciated the option to request a late checkout.

Ok so moving forward with our lunch not having an appetite to eat much I go and take a piece of my Kim chee and under that piece there was a piece of hair.. Talk about being disgusted.. I tell another waitress and she tells the owner and the owner comes to the table and was like I'm sorry blah blah blah.. Then the owner and waitress started to talk in their language and started to laugh looking at the plate.. Talk about feeling like crap as being the customer.. Then the owner goes well it could be your hair.. That was it, I was being so nice and professional with the whole matter after all it wasn't my fault and believe me we have the money to pay for our meal so trying to get a free meal is something I was not trying to do.

{"id":634,"text":"Triple 7 is hands down my go-to spot for a meal when I find myself in downtown Vegas. Unlike many people, I prefer to steer clear of the traditional dinner options like The Chart House or Hugo's Cellar, especially since I don't want to splurge on a meal when I'll be spending the rest of my evening gambling and exploring Fremont Street. Between the hours of 12 AM and 3 AM, you can always find me at Triple 7, and let me tell you, I've never been disappointed with my orders. It's quite rare for a restaurant to consistently impress me with every dish, but Triple 7 manages to do just that. This place truly is a hidden gem, as other reviews have mentioned. Now, let's talk about the must-try items on their menu. First, the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich is a vegetarian delight that never fails to satisfy. Pair it with their Triple 7 Wings and a few of their signature Triple 7 Brews, and you're in for a flavor explosion. The Monterey Chicken Sandwich is another winner, as is their Fish & Chips. And when I'm feeling a little tipsy, my go-to choice is the heavenly Baked Italian Sub. I could go on and on about the amazing food options at Triple 7. If you ever find yourself downtown and in need of a solid meal, look no further. This is, without a doubt, the best place to dine at. Don't hesitate to give it a shot - you won't be disappointed. Trust me, Triple 7 always delivers.","label":"ai"}

Other dishes like the salt cod fritters and the marinated olives were too salty, and the gambas al mole was boring. The chorizo con huevos dish seemed mismatched and the chorizo was lackluster. The patatas bravas were just simple fried potatoes and the churros, while tasty, were undercooked. The service was also lacking, with the waitress not knowing the specials.

The Po Boy Shrimp Flatbread was subtly flavored, with a delicate hint of seafood that wasn't overpowering. The only area that needs improvement was the overall taste of the meal.

{"id":661,"text":"Popped into this joint a couple months back. Bangin' threads. I'd only peeped the gear on their website but they've got a way wider range in-store. While I was having a browse, the stuck-up shop boss seemed proper miffed that folk wanted to try on the clobber before splashing the cash. I've done my time in retail too, and I know it's a hassle when it's heaving, but that's just part of the game. She'd be jobless if it weren't buzzing. She kept on giving me, my mates, and the other punters a stinking attitude. When we got to the till, the lass wanted to check if we'd found all we needed, we politely said yeah, but the queue behind us was getting longer. When another bird tried to open the second till, the shop boss properly embarrassed her by snappily telling her to stick to counting stock. And the stock was just vests on a table - there were tons of them. Blew my mind that she'd talk to the staff that way, especially when she was trying to get us to part with our dosh. Hope she's copped on that this ain't the gig for her and has bailed. She was a total nightmare.","label":"ai"}

{"id":664,"text":"I was so hyped to try out Gordon Ramsay's restaurant because I'm a huge fan of his TV shows. But man, was I disappointed. We ordered some ice water with lemon, but we only got plain ice water - what a letdown. For an appetizer, we got the onion rings and they were super greasy, but the homemade ranch was bomb. The chipotle ketchup was just okay. For our main course, we tried the \"Farmer's Burger\" (or something like that), the \"Hells Kitchen Burger\", and Truffle Fries with Truffle Aioli. The Farmer's Burger was a 3.5 out of 5 - not bad, but not great. The Hells Kitchen Burger, though, was a disaster. It was so burnt on the bottom that all I could taste was char, and it had zero seasoning. We told the new waiter about it (there was a shift change mid-service), and he brought us a less cooked burger, but it still had no seasoning. The roasted vegetables and thickly cut avocado on top had no salt at all, except for what was in the cheese. It was a culinary crime. I won't be going back, and I'll definitely never eat at a Ramsay restaurant again. To try and fix the issue with another unseasoned burger told me that it was supposed to be bland. No thanks. I could've had a way better meal at In N Out for half the price. The fries were alright, but they definitely couldn't save the meal. Overall, this was a major disappointment. I had such high hopes, but it just didn't deliver. Save your money and go somewhere else.","label":"ai"}

They are only open for dinner, so if you decide last minute call right when they open and I've been able to grab either a late dinner (after 10) or at the bar. They are usualy very busy and packed though, but because of their small size they can't accommodate a large volume.\\n\\nThey have their staple foods like wasabi kobe beef, bacon wrapped asparagus, their 1\/2 cold 1\/2 fried tofu, and of course their daily specials. I always try to get atleast 1 dish off their specials. Be sure to get any of their whole fish whenever it's offered. They serve half of it sashimi style and the pieces literally melt in your mouth. The other half they threw on the grill and it was so moist. I am not a fan of foie gras but I tried some of their egg custard a friend ordered and it was delicious. I don't think I've ever been disappointed with a dish I've ordered from here and I've almost tried everything. I would say the average price is about $30-40 per person unless you include alcohol then it will go up.

{"id":674,"text":"The worst part about Vegas is the overabundance of Asian\/Islander food. You can't escape it, and this place is no exception. They used to have a deal for 5 dollars which has now risen to 6.25. Not worth it, because with tax it's 6.75 and 8 dollars with tip. (Don't bother tipping - they don't deserve it!) They give you these three long pieces of teriyaki chicken (I had no idea chickens were so tall??) on teriyaki day. It's not even that good. I tried to give my partner the macaroni salad with sriracha and bits of my chicken mixed in, but even she wasn't impressed (damn islanders!). When I'm alone, I always say hold the mayonnaise (I can't even spell the word it's so revolting) and just have 3 scoops of rice. There are 3 or 4 locations, but after trying the one on Rainbow, I can tell you that the WS and Eastern spot is the worst of the lot. I would go out of my way to avoid meeting people there.

The bartender (Jennifer), while not unpleasant to look at, was extremely slow. She walked past my empty beer glass all night; the only way I was able to get a beer was to get her attention, which was difficult, since she was busy fooling around with her phone and doing God knows what else, and ask her point blank for a beer. When I was able to finally order an entree, she recommended at \\\"Daytona\\\" sauce, which was goopy, sickly sweet, and horrible. The worst, and unforgiveable part, was that there was a mix-up with the tabs, and the manager came over and informed me that I could order no more alcohol, since I had already has TEN beers. I had NOT had ten beers; believe me, if I had wanted to have ten beers, it would have been impossible in the short time I was there, with the inattentive bartender.

Despite my previous experience of braving the Black Friday madness last year (I was forced to use a specific voucher that weekend), I thought I'd outsmart the system and shop on a quiet weekend morning. The store was almost empty and everything was neatly arranged, yet there wasn't a single shopping bag in sight. Incredibly, I managed to pick up four items despite the bag shortage. However, since I was using a gift voucher, the store's policy prevented me from returning or exchanging my purchases, which left me without a receipt and stuck with an unsuitable gift. It's mind-boggling that I didn't face these issues during the hectic Black Friday shopping rush. In addition, the store's policy of allowing customers to bring in alcoholic beverages is a recipe for disaster - I witnessed a woman attempting to ascend an escalator in the wrong direction. This happened at the Forum Shops, and I must say, Forever 21 would never tolerate such a lack of organization and customer consideration.","label":"ai"}

{"id":682,"text":"I am rating this establishment a mere 2 stars, despite being a regular customer due to its proximity. I've yet to have a satisfactory experience here, though I keep hoping for better. I do enjoy their bagels, but they are consistently stingy with the cream cheese. I remember when Einsteins used to slather their bagels with cream cheese, but now it's so sparse I can see the bagel underneath, or find portions devoid of cream cheese completely. As a New Yorker, I need a generous amount of cream cheese! The staff is always pleasant, but the service is usually painfully slow. The combination of inadequate cream cheese and prolonged waiting time results in the 2-star rating. Here's hoping it's just teething problems due to them being relatively new, and they'll soon improve their standards.","label":"ai"}
{"id":683,"text":"I am a frequent book buyer and love to visit different bookstores, but my recent experience at this establishment was extremely disappointing. As someone who prefers physical books over e-readers, I was excited to browse through the selection at this store. However, my excitement quickly turned into frustration and annoyance. Firstly, the layout of the store was chaotic and disorganized, with sections being rearranged and a new toy section being added. While these changes could have been exciting, they were overshadowed by the reckless behavior of one of the store's employees. On multiple occasions, an older gentleman operating a dolly nearly ran over my two-year-old child without so much as an apology or excuse me. It was evident that customer safety and courtesy were not a priority for this individual, and I was left feeling like an inconvenience in his way. Despite this unpleasant encounter, I still decided to make a purchase and spent over $100 on books. However, the checkout experience was no better. The employee at the register was unfriendly and unhelpful, showing no interest in offering me a membership or providing any kind of customer service. It was clear that my business was not valued, and I was treated with a dismissive attitude. As a result of this experience, I have decided to take my book-buying business elsewhere. While I appreciate the store's selection, the lack of respect and courtesy from the staff has driven me to seek alternative options, such as online retailers like Amazon. The disregard for customer satisfaction and the apparent prioritization of setting up Christmas displays over basic customer etiquette is unacceptable. In conclusion, I was deeply disappointed by the lack of professionalism and basic manners displayed by the employees at this bookstore. It is evident that customer service is not a priority for them, and I will not be returning to this establishment in the future. I hope that the management takes this feedback seriously and makes the necessary changes to improve the overall customer experience.","label":"ai"}

{"id":689,"text":"I was extremely disappointed with my experience at this costume shop. First of all, the lack of dressing rooms is completely unacceptable. Trying on costumes in the middle of aisles is not only inconvenient, but also uncomfortable for both customers and other shoppers. The fact that there are no alternative options if the sample size doesn't fit is frustrating and shows a lack of consideration for the customer's needs. The customer service was also severely lacking. I came in with the intention of finding a specific costume for my child, and despite the initial offer of assistance, I was completely ignored after the first interaction. The staff member who said he would help me never returned, and when I went to the register to make a purchase, I was met with a group of unhelpful and unfriendly employees. One of them, in particular, was outright rude and made me feel unwelcome. The overall attitude of the staff was unprofessional and made the entire experience unpleasant. In addition to the poor customer service, the prices at this establishment are exorbitant. After comparing prices with other stores, I found that many of the costumes sold here are significantly more expensive than elsewhere. For example, a costume that I saw at another store for a much lower price was being sold at Halloween Mart for a $40.00 markup. This price gouging is unjustifiable, especially given the lackluster service provided. Overall, I would not recommend this costume shop to anyone. The lack of dressing rooms, poor customer service, and inflated prices make it a place to avoid. There are plenty of other options for purchasing costumes, and I would highly encourage others to seek out alternative retailers. Save yourself the frustration and disappointment and shop elsewhere for your costume needs.","label":"ai"}
{"id":690,"text":"Alright, listen up folks! If you're a regular in Sin City, you know that Las Vegas is like the holy grail for foodies. It's packed with some of the world's top-notch chefs and their fancy-schmancy restaurants. The only problem is, most of these joints are crammed into smoky casinos, overpriced, and more focused on the glitz and glam than the actual grub. Now, I gotta admit, you gotta go to Switch at least once. It's like watching a freakin' magic show as the walls change and the roof spins right before your very eyes. It's mind-blowing, and it might just distract you from the fact that you're about to get slapped with a $400 bill. Talk about no pain, no gain, baby! But hey, for those of you who wanna brag about going \"off the strip,\" I gotta tell ya, you gotta check out The Barrymore. It ain't got no flashy dancers, laser light shows, or ice sculptures. What it does have is that good ol' Vegas charm, and oh boy, does it serve up some amazing food! The vibe at The Barrymore is more Lionel Barrymore than Drew Barrymore in every freakin' way. The dining room is cozy as hell, with plush booths and a classy 40's-style movie theme. You'll feel like you're in one of those old-school Hollywood flicks, where you might just spot Bogey or Grant sippin' on a cosmopolitan with a beautiful babe. And let me tell ya, the staff at this joint is top-notch too. From the minute we walked in, we were treated like freakin' royalty. Our head waiter was rockin' a white dinner jacket, lookin' like he just served Lionel himself. He knew the menu inside out, had some killer recommendations for drinks, and even shared his two cents on the wine selection. The evening manager even swung by our table, introduced himself, and wanted to make sure we were havin' a blast. Now, let's talk about the grub. We dived into some juicy NY Strip steak, tender braised short ribs, and a damn delicious risotto. Each dish was cooked to perfection, high-quality ingredients, and left us with big ol' smiles on our faces. But let me tell ya, the real showstopper was the roasted artichoke. I swear, that flavor still dances in my taste buds two weeks later. So, if you're in Vegas and you're lookin' for some trendy joint with a celebrity chef plastered on the Food Network, then go ahead and stay on the strip. Grab yourself a $35 shrimp cocktail while the slot machines serenade you. But if you want a classy, elegant dining experience with that true \"old Vegas\" feel, then you gotta give The Barrymore a shot. Trust me, it's like night and day, my friends!","label":"ai"}

People in the community rave about their Portuguese buns, but honestly, I found them to be nothing special. And for $3.60 a dozen, I expected something more than just mediocre bread. I also tried their Fried Cod Balls, and let me tell you, they were a major letdown. Whether I had them cold, room temperature, or slightly warmed, they were just plain tasteless. The same goes for their mini empanadas, or \"rissois,\" which lacked any flavor or excitement. And don't even get me started on their pasteis de nata. Sure, they're cheap at $1.25 each or $12 for a dozen, but they were far from yummy. The custard filling was bland and lacked any depth of flavor. Overall, I couldn't help but feel let down by this place. Despite the friendly service and the catchy Portuguese name, the food simply did not live up to the hype.

And 3 stars is the best they can get out of me with their soft opening effort.\\n\\nBut first let me just explain what White Rabbit Fusion Cafe is to those not familiar with this food truck from California turned brick and mortar LV restaurant. It is Filipino comfort\/street food proteins (Chicken Adobo, Pork Sisig, Pork Longanisa, etcetera.) packaged in traditional Mexican food delivery vessels (i.e., your tacos, burritos, quesadilla).\\n\\nThe portion is just underwhelming for me, but I can pack a lot of food away, so I am biased. But they have Tofu on the menu for vegetarians. The concept of someone ordering something vegetarian at a Filipino Fusion place is just so foreign to me. But it is available.\\n\\nPricing seems high to me for what you get. The fact that it is in or near one of the busier plazas in the \\\"Chinatown District\\\" makes their pricing strategy suspect. If it was something served from a food truck at FoodieFest,I can see the reasoning behind the carnival-like pricing, but not such a great incentive from a brick and mortar operation. I know, it does not make sense, but I stand by my opinion.\\n\\nThe cashier, even though this was her first job ever, was nice. The order was prepared quickly and correctly, which is expected but still nice. My Pork Sisig Burrito had a good ratio of pork sisig to rice ratio, but was on the dried side. Portion seems to be designed for a growing 5 year old or someone on a weight loss plan.\\n\\nStill just a 3 star-ish experience overall for me.

I recently had a server not only talk to us for over 10 minutes about his name before he took our order,but also had the nerve to solicit help and funds for his charity. I was appalled that he continued on and that the manager did not put a stop to it. i think I was more irritated because if he spent as much time on assisting our table as he did talking about himself, our order would not have been screwed up so bad!","label":"human"}

{"id":704,"text":"I had a little trouble finding the Cosmopolitan Hotel at first, but once I did, I was pleasantly surprised. The third floor location, with its unmarked hallway lined with old record sleeves, felt like a hidden gem. The mostly standing room layout with pinball machines and TVs showing sports created a fun and casual atmosphere. The drinks were a bit pricey at $4 per cup, but I was happy to discover a water filtration machine in the corner where I could get free water. The custom pizza took a while to make, but the option to heat a slice from the already made pizzas was convenient, even though the base price of $4.50 for a cheese slice felt a bit steep. I tried the pepperoni and sausage slice for $5.50 and found it to be just okay. The sausage lacked flavor, but the pepperoni was tasty, albeit a little salty. The standout for me was the white pizza. The combination of ricotta and garlic made it resistant to sogginess and the taste was delicious. The crust was thin, crunchy, and held up well, making it a great base for the pizzas. The white pizza was definitely the winner for me. Overall, the Cosmopolitan Hotel's pizza joint was a unique and enjoyable experience. Despite the slightly high prices and average toppings, the great crust and delicious white pizza made it a worthwhile visit. I would definitely recommend trying the white pizza - it's a must-have!","label":"ai"}

The decor is a nice blend of old world style and sharp modern lines.\\n\\nIn giving the place five stars, I must admit that I had recently eaten meals featuring duck hearts, sea snails, and bone marrow, so I was ready for a hearty, more classic bistro meal.\\n\\nFirst, I ordered the Country Seasonal Vegetable soup (around 8$). It was the best vegetable soup I have ever eaten at a restaurant- perfectly balanced flavour that was not too salty, spicy, or bland.\\n\\nFor my main course I had the steak and frites (around 21$). The steak was perfectly cooked and flavourful. The frites were blessedly not overcooked or oversalted.\\n\\nDessert featured several options. I chose a butterscotch dessert (around 9$) that had ice cream and an individually cooked cream filled butterscotch cake. It was pure deliciousness.\\n\\nThe service here was great. Food came in a timely manner, and my group never waited for water refills or plates to be cleared. \\n\\nI would return to eat at Holder's tomorrow.

I had the homemade tagliatelle with meatballs and spare ribs. While it was pricey, I easily could have split this dish with a dining companion and we would have both still been satisfied. The desserts were equally good, well presented but also quite rich and decandant.\\n\\nThe decor is really special. Lots of red, and unexpected textures.

It was filled with mediocre rice and beans and all the typical add-ons that you would find at a fast food place similar to Chipotle. The burrito also came with a pile of stale chips.\\n\\nService was slow because there was only one person working. So, she had to assemble the food and ring it up.

{"id":715,"text":"I had high expectations for this deli based on the glowing reviews from my family, but unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory. It is important to note that I did not personally dine at this establishment, but relied on the opinions of my family members who insisted I write a positive review. However, I cannot in good conscience do so, as the quality of the food and service left much to be desired. While my aunt raved about the beef and cheddar melt on focaccia, I found it to be a major disappointment. The bread may have smelled enticing, but its taste fell short of my expectations. Despite its appearance, it failed to effectively contain the overwhelming amount of beef and cheddar. The beef itself was mediocre at best, likely due to the insistence of my family to have it cooked more thoroughly. I can only imagine how much better it would have been if prepared as intended. In an attempt to salvage my meal, I opted for the pastrami sandwich, hoping for a similar experience to the renowned Carnegie Deli's pastrami. Sadly, it did not live up to the hype. While the portion size was indeed generous, the taste was lacking. It paled in comparison to the authentic New York deli experience I had hoped for. The highlight of the meal, according to my aunt, was the chicken noodle soup. However, as I am unable to partake in it, I cannot personally vouch for its quality. My aunt, on the other hand, claimed it was exceptional, even going so far as to compare it to the soup she craved during times of illness. She insisted it had a magical ability to make one feel better instantly. However, I cannot help but be skeptical of such exaggerated claims. Overall, my experience at this deli was underwhelming. The lackluster food and overhyped dishes left me dissatisfied. While my family may have enjoyed their meals, I cannot endorse this establishment based on their opinions alone. If you are seeking a truly authentic New York deli experience, I would advise looking elsewhere.","label":"ai"}

{"id":719,"text":"I recently dined at The Keg with my partner, opting for this restaurant as our first choice, Flemings, was fully booked. The staff at The Keg were indeed accommodating and friendly, and our server was excellent - checking in frequently and attending to our needs. We enjoyed a delicious bottle of Ridge wine and the brie appetizer was very good. However, the main course, a bacon-wrapped filet cooked medium rare, was disappointing. The steak arrived wrapped in bacon fat and was closer to rare than medium rare. While I occasionally enjoy a rare steak, the bacon gristle was unappetizing. The creme brulee for dessert was average at best. It seems that The Keg prioritizes speed over attention to detail when it comes to their food, and as a result, it doesn't compare to other steak houses. Overall, I would consider The Keg to be a AAA club, and if you're seeking a high-quality steak experience, I would recommend looking elsewhere such as Flemings or Ruth Chris for a more satisfying dining experience.","label":"ai"}
{"id":720,"text":"So I'm torn about what to say to be honest. The place had a cool retro grannies feel to it with some yummy and different takes on traditional food. Really liked how many Veg options there were. I came in after reading rave reviews about their brunch... but when I went it was lunch so I wasn't feeling very brunch-ie... My husband still got the eggs Benedict with salmon ( i forgot what it was called on the menu) and it was AMAZING! Like really it was so good I totally understood why people had raved so much! I unfortunately had ordered a soup and 1\/2 sandwich combo. I was still hopeful because my chick-pea and chicken sandwich sounded delightful, and my grain tomato soup hearty. Well lets just say next time I will be ordering ONLY from the breakfast section. I might be sounding a bit unfair b\/c I have only been there once... but literally there was only like a table spoon of filling in my sandwich and the rest was salad:( the soups was good but not enough to save my lunch.

{"id":722,"text":"My wife and I decided to try out this place during a surprisingly temperate weekend in Phoenix. The agreeable weather was perhaps the only saving grace of this outdoor restaurant. We visited The Farm @ South Mountain on a Sunday morning and were subjected to a rather long wait, which was somewhat mitigated by the scenic surroundings. However, it's a poor substitute for being seated promptly. We were placed at a 4-top table, an unnecessary excess considering we were just a party of two. I had the American Breakfast, which was a mediocre ensemble of scrambled eggs, home fries, applewood smoked bacon, and a biscuit that was hyped up but fell flat in terms of taste. We ordered two more, hoping the first was just a dud, but we were disappointed twice. My wife had the local Schreiner's sausage, tomato, and cheese omelette. While she didn't complain, I could tell she was unsatisfied with the portion size. The food was alright, but nothing special. Our server was overly sweet to the point of being saccharine. What really irked us was the deceptive beverage bar. They had lemonade, tea, and water lined up in large canteens, tricking us into thinking they were complimentary. But to our dismay, they were included in our bill. A heads up about this would have been appreciated. Despite this, we doubt we'll be returning. The experience was overall unimpressive and underwhelming.","label":"ai"}
{"id":723,"text":"The service has always been \\\"not so great\\\", to say the least, but the last time we went, it was so bad, that it was almost comical. The waitress didn't pay any attention to us for about 10 minutes even though not much was going on there. When I got up to get her, she over-the-top apologized, first saying that she thought the other waitress had us, and then a minute later saying that she forgot she hadn't brought us water yet. This pattern of lying repeated itself when my husband got the wrong order and when she disappeared out of the restaurant for extensive periods of time (about 3 times). First she had one \\\"reason\\\", then another... By the end, we were both really pissed off and my husband told her that he doesn't care about the \\\"why\\\". I did feel bad for her, but she did ruin our dinner.

{"id":733,"text":"I gotta be honest, I never really liked fish tacos until I came to this place. Last Saturday, my friends and I swung by before heading to the Grape Stomp at PGH winery. Let me tell you, this place did not disappoint! My buddies and I were recommended to check it out by some foodie friends of ours, and they were totally right. The fish tacos were the bomb. The fish was so fresh and flavorful, it was a game changer. Unlike other fish tacos I've had, these ones were made with swordfish, tuna, and salmon. They were also presented so beautifully, it was almost a shame to eat them. If you're a fan of fish tacos, this place is a must-visit. And if you can, go on Taco Tuesday for a sweet discount. My friends ordered the crab tacos and the fried English cod sandwich, and they loved them. They used to live in Maine and said this was the best seafood they've had in PGH in the three years they've been living here. The vibe in this place is super casual and relaxed. We snagged a spot by the big front windows, which was perfect for some solid people watching. The only thing that really weirded me out was their ordering and payment system. Instead of paying up front, you pay after you're done eating. It was a bit confusing, and I didn't even think about tipping since you order and pay at the counter, not at the table. Overall, this place is awesome and I'd totally recommend it if you're into seafood and find yourself in the Strip. I'm definitely coming back to try the sushi, it looked so good!","label":"ai"}

Particularly, a representative named Monica made the experience smooth and efficient. Living three hours from Champaign, where my wedding was held, required a lot of communication via email with Monica. She was patient, detailed and very responsive. Repeated information was often asked for, to ensure absolute accuracy. On the wedding day, the guys looked dapper in their black vests. Each vest, though the same color, had an individual style that added a unique flair to the event. The variety was unexpectedly pleasing and made for some great photos! A friend of mine also had her wedding managed by Monica and despite a minor mix-up with the shoe orders, Michelle's was quick to offer a refund. They showed great integrity and customer service in handling the situation. In conclusion, Michelle's offers a reliable and unique service for tuxedo rentals.

{"id":738,"text":"I recently stumbled upon this charming French-themed bakery nestled in a somewhat run-down shopping plaza, and it turned out to be a delightful surprise. The selection of breads, pastries, and desserts is truly impressive, and the aroma of freshly baked goods is enough to make anyone's mouth water. On my most recent visit, I opted for a somewhat healthier choice and ordered the full-size pastrami sandwich and a cappuccino to share with my partner. To my delight, the order was promptly served, and the sandwich exceeded my expectations. The thinly sliced pastrami was bursting with flavor, and the soft, crispy baguette it was served on was a perfect complement. The house-made condiments were a standout, adding an extra layer of freshness and deliciousness to the sandwich. To my surprise, the sandwich also came with a small salad that was equally delicious, featuring mixed greens, red onion, tomato, and a house dressing that I couldn't get enough of. It's safe to say that whoever is in charge of creating the sauces at this bakery is a true culinary genius. After this wonderful experience, my partner and I have already decided that this bakery will become our go-to spot for \"Bakery Date Night\", especially since they offer double ad day every Wednesday. We're already planning our next visit to try out the other sandwiches and perhaps indulge in a cup of their sought-after soup. And let's not forget about the perfect cappuccino that accompanied our meal. It was just the right size and had us savoring every sip.

On the positive side, the fish tacos were delicious and messy in a good way. However, the cactus tacos were just average and the black bean taco was bland and dry.

Apparently, I was really motivated this morning at McDonald's.\\n\\nNo one over the age of eight goes to McDonald's for the food. We either go because it's quick (sometimes) or cheap (not anymore) or convenient or because we are craving that childhood food memory. So Jim and I met there this morning (score one for convenient) for a quick snack and chat about the week.\\n\\nWhile we're waiting for the food I notice a sign that says they have free samples on Monday morning. I was fascinated by this. Since when has McDonald's offered samples? And who hasn't tried their potatoes and needs to know what they taste like? Who doesn't know the taste of crunchy grease without a reminder? So, curiosity getting the better of me, I asked for a sample. I really wanted to see what it was. That's when I was reminded where, exactly, I was.\\n\\nI was told that there was no way I could have a sample. When I inquired why that was I was informed that the person accompanying me had ordered what they were sampling.\\n\\nOh.\\n\\nThough most yelpers know my prolific yelper husband, this woman did not. In fact, she had no idea who he was in relation to me. He could have been my husband but he could just as easily been an anal colleague who would rather die than allow me to sample his food, which I assume was the implication in her refusal.\\n\\nNow, I acknowledge that this is a ridiculous nothing of an issue.

So, I guess they saved themselves a quarter of a hash brown but they got this nifty review instead.\\n\\nAs to the biscuit I did eat, well... it was McDonald's.","label":"human"}

Slippers were also provided if you did not want to bring your own. \\n\\nThe quiet room only had a couple chairs where you could prop your legs up and a few magazines available. \\n\\nI got a Swedish massage and it was pretty awesome. The tables were warm, but I wish the lights in the room were a little dimmer. \\n\\nThe body wash and shampoo\/conditioner spell heavenly (I think grapefruit). The lotion in the vanity area were of the same scent. Razors are available upon request. The typical spa items were also available: Hair dryers, straighteners (on request), curling irons, combs\/brushes, hair spray and other products, facial cleanser, body lotion, qtips and cotton pads, and mouthwash.\\n\\nThere were multiple whirlpools with different temperature water. Be sure to reserve a lounge chair in that area because they are limited and most people nap here. The sauna and steam room were pretty normal.","label":"human"}

{"id":754,"text":"Came in to get my fingerprints done, which I thought would take a year and a day since this location also deals with impounds. NOT SO... They have coordinated the flow of people so well that you talk to someone at a window within minutes about fingerprinting, they take debit\/credit cards to pay the like $8 fee (not sure about that price, double check). Then within minutes, they take you to the back, pat you down to make sure you're not a sociopath and do your prints. It's that easy. Plus, they had wipes to clean your fingers off and I've heard of horror stories for other police departments about leaving with gummy black fingers. I will DEFINITELY be going back to this location if I need my fingerprints done for a clearance card again. : )","label":"human"}

Takeout or delivery is the way to go. Remember to grab a menu and call in your order to avoid delivery fees and ensure correct instructions.","label":"ai"}
{"id":756,"text":"This club strictly enforces a dress code and has an overall pretentious attitude. The atmosphere was tacky and overpriced, resembling a poor imitation of Vegas.

{"id":759,"text":"Our experience at Razz's left much to be desired. Razz himself was having a temperamental evening, berating his staff and disrupting the calm ambience with his booming voice. So, if you're seeking a peaceful dining experience, Razz's may not be your cup of tea. What was more disappointing was the quality of the food considering the steep prices. My wife's Sea Bass special was overcooked and dry, which contrasted poorly with the uncooked side vegetables. I opted for the Bouillabaisse ($29). Although I'm not a professional cook, even I understand that overcooking shrimp results in tough, rubbery bites. It seems Razz and his team lack this basic culinary knowledge. The saving grace was the other seafood in the dish (mussels\/clams) which were cooked satisfactorily, and a flavorful broth. The only thing that tempered our disappointment was a Groupon discount that lessened the blow of the bill. Otherwise, we would have been truly displeased. There are certainly superior fine dining options available in the valley, and we'd recommend exploring those before considering Razz's.","label":"ai"}

Sandra, the server, is efficient and friendly, while Ricardo, the chef, is a master of his craft and adds a personal touch to the dining experience. To avoid the long wait, late-night dining is recommended. Will definitely be returning!","label":"ai"}

{"id":765,"text":"I fondly remember my regular visits to Pumi during 2006-2007, where the sushi chefs' creativity and the friendly service was unmatched. After a change in management, however, things took a slightly different turn. The freshness of the fish and the pricing were not up to the mark, which led us to take a break from Pumi. After a reasonable gap, we revisited Pumi last night. As I am expecting, I could not indulge in sushi, so we opted for a hibachi experience. Unfortunately, the lighting was not adequate. However, the amiable hibachi chef and his tasty preparation of rice, vegetables, and chicken compensated for it. The shrimp could have been less rubbery, and my husband's NY steak seemed a bit thinner than usual. I understand restaurants need to manage their costs but would prefer that the pricing reflects these changes. The hibachi sauce, however, was a slight letdown as it tasted like watery mayonnaise. The service was satisfactory. To conclude, Pumi, I feel there is some scope for improvement. I might give it another shot, but perhaps not for another couple of years. Despite the minor hiccups, I hold on to the good memories of the creative sushi and friendly service that once defined Pumi.","label":"ai"}

{"id":768,"text":"First off, I'm not sure why this place is getting so many bad reviews. (I booked this reservation online and gave my last name, credit card, and driver's license when checking in)\\n\\nRoyal Resort is located on Convention Center Drive which is across the street from Circus Circus and under the shadow of the Encore Tower. With a location like this, you will probably be driving to get to where you need to go on the Strip.\\n\\nWhile Royal Resort will provide you with a parking permit, the parking behind the back of the hotel is very plentiful even during nighttime hours, a plus.\\n\\nI'm not sure what people are saying when they say it's noisy. I could not hear any of the noise from the outside, but the AC was sort of loud, but it didn't bother me. Better to stay cool than roast from the Vegas heat. Then again I was located on the 7th floor but near the elevator. I could hear some commotion as people opened and closed their doors but other than that the room itself was fairly quiet.\\n\\nFor me, I was able to get LTE\/4G on my iPhone 5 so there was no need to pay for $10 WiFi. If you need internet that badly and don't want to pay the $10 go to a Starbucks.\\n\\nDepending on your room (1 bed rooms have a microwave, fridge, and pull-out bed, and 2 bed rooms only have a fridge), the accommodations were sufficient given the price and location.\\n\\nThe hotel itself is clean, and the staff (at least for me) were friendly. Housekeeping service did knock on our doors at around 9 AM the next morning as we did not have a sign out. They were happy to provide us with extra towels.\\n\\nThe staff working the Reception were friendly and accommodating when I wanted a 2 bed room and not a 1 bed room. They were quick to make the adjustments and didn't give me any flak for it. All I had to do was return the old room keys and that was that.\\n\\nRoyal Resort is a great choice if you want a no-frills cheap option to stay in Vegas. It has no Casino and a definite lack of nearby food options, but that's what your car or taxi man\/woman is for.","label":"human"}

She barely listened to my hair needs and her service was quite generic. On my first visit, the layers she cut weren't satisfactory, even though they looked decent, so I had to return for adjustments.

The cod fish and chips are the bomb, but everything's a bit pricier than it should be. Still, I'm cool with supporting a local joint.

They also didn't keep the condiments stocked, as the ketchup needed to be refilled. It was an okay dining experience, but definitely not what I was expecting.

Bland, flavorless, and way too much bread. The burger didn't even cover the bun - what's up with that? And it was all hacked up, not cool. My buddy got the steak wrap, which was more like a rice burrito with barely any steak. Not worth the $11. And then my kid's flatbread had a hair in it - gross. When we told the manager, he just walked away, no apology or anything. Not cool, man. And don't even get me started on the outside dining area - a total mess. Food everywhere, not a good look.

{"id":784,"text":"So, I went to this place in the Imperial Palace hotel and let me tell you, the portions are HUGE. Like, seriously massive. The place is pretty big too, with two different rooms and all. I had a simple breakfast - eggs, hash browns, biscuit, and coffee. The biscuit was so buttery and fresh and warm, and like everything else there, it was HUGE. I usually love carbs, but I couldn't finish the biscuit or the rest of the meal. The food was great and the prices were fair considering the amount of food you get. My meal was 9 bucks, which was on the lower end. But then, someone straight up threw up in there. Like, I heard it and then saw a guy running out and a puke-splattered woman. It was pretty horrific, especially for my first meal of the day.

Unfortunately, they only sell it in sets, which is a hassle if you just need one bottle. They do have some other decent items like vitamins and fruit bars, but the selection of DVDs and books is hit or miss. Now, here's the real problem: who in the world needs a massive tub of mayo, 500 cans of tuna, or a mountain of lettuce? As a single person, this place is just not practical for me. It might be suitable for large families or organizations, but definitely not for individuals like me or anyone seeking variety.","label":"ai"}

{"id":787,"text":"I swear, this place deserves negative stars if that was even a thing. I've been to this Mellow Mushroom so many times, and every time the service is just meh.

After a birthday party next door, our group of 20 went in for drinks and some reverse happy hour fun. After 2 hours and just one drink, I was told our whole party was cut off from getting any more drinks. Like, what? When I asked why, the bartender\/manager just sassed me and walked away. No explanation, just attitude. It's 11:30 on a Friday night, what kind of crowd do they expect? Definitely not someone getting cut off after one drink. This place is supposed to be a bar, with a variety of beers on tap, but the service is just terrible. If you want drinks and food, go somewhere else. There are plenty of other choices in the area.

{"id":793,"text":"I cannot express strongly enough how much I regret ever setting foot in this establishment. The experience I had here was nothing short of a nightmare, and I believe that this place should be permanently shut down. Several years ago, I made the grave mistake of bringing my beloved puppy, Lucy, to this clinic to be spayed. From the moment I walked in, the staff was incredibly rude and dismissive, making me feel like a burden for asking any questions about the procedure. When I picked Lucy up, her incision looked like a horrific, sloppy mess, and despite my concerns, the staff assured me that everything was fine and refused to provide any pain medication for her. As a result, Lucy suffered immensely, crying and wailing in pain for days on end. As if that experience wasn't enough, things only got worse when my brother brought his puppy, Leo, to this clinic for neutering. When they picked Leo up, he was bleeding profusely, and when they voiced their concerns to the staff, they were callously reassured that it was normal. However, the bleeding only got worse, to the point where Leo's scrotum was completely filled with blood and swollen. It wasn't until they rushed him to an emergency pet clinic that they were informed that he could have bled out overnight if they hadn't sought immediate help. The emergency clinic also revealed that they see a significant number of cases that originate from this clinic. I implore anyone reading this to steer clear of this place at all costs if you value the well-being of your pets. I will never set foot in this establishment again, and I hope that others will heed my warning and avoid the suffering that comes from entrusting their beloved animals to this negligent and dangerous facility.","label":"ai"}

I really think TI is in need of hiring a new director of food and beverage because the restaurant selections at the hotel are so bad it's not even funny. Anyway, I wanted something quick and easy so I went ahead and got a chili cheese hot dog with coleslaw on the side. The dog was wrapped in some funny plastic sheet so when I was ready to eat the darn thing it was super soggy and nasty. I ended up just using a knife and fork to assault my food. The hot dog itself tastes like any store bought, mass produced amalgamation of meats. The chili didn't taste that well and I wouldn't be surprised if it came out of a bag. Coleslaw was surprisingly refreshing and good. I tried some of their house cut fries and they were nicely done!

{"id":800,"text":"This place was just okay, but seriously, for $39.99, it should have been way better. I walked in there and was like, \"That's it?\" Some of the food was good and I even went for seconds, but was it worth $39.99? I don't think so. I had to convince myself it was worth it at the time because I couldn't believe it. They did have some cool things though, like the crepe station and the ice cream thing. Aladdin before Planet Hollywood had a better buffet than Wynn, no offense. When I got to the dessert area, I was like, \"What the heck? Is this all?\" I don't even remember if they had carrot cake, which is a must for me in a good buffet. Maybe I ate it, but I can't remember because I was so hung up on the $39.99. The only place I can compare it to is Bellagio, which is much better in many ways. If they charged $29.99, I would have given it one more star. Haha, and I thought the $26.99 holiday meal at Mandalay was expensive. That's nothing compared to this. Oh, and the whole king crab leg thing is not even a big deal anymore. Most hotels have king crab legs. I wonder if going to Vegas on Presidents Day counts as a holiday.","label":"ai"}

If you're with a group of girls and get yourself on the VIP list, at least it'll cut your wait time a ton. You still have to get your bag \\\"raped\\\" by security to make sure that you don't bring anything unacceptable, which apparently includes inflatable animals as well! This can take awhile since us girls often bring beach bags with touch up make up, chapstick, extra clothes, you name it, we \\\"like to be prepared,\\\" But when it's 115 degrees outside at the end of June, damn! Any length of time is too long to be waiting in line.\\n\\nThe water itself was also quite warm. It wasn't quite as relievingly refreshing as I'd hoped it be. Maybe that was a subtle ploy to get people to buy the $20-30 frozen drinks, which my friends did thoroughly enjoy! \\n\\nGreat place to people watch! After all, people are in their designer swimwear and are there to party, so there was never a shortage of entertaining displays of pick up lines and dancing. Wet Republic hosts such well known artists, like Tiesto and Calvin Harris, on certain days so it's awesome to enjoy their music and see them in person and in action!\\n\\nI must admit though, being spoiled is definitely the way to go here.

The frequent interruptions by our waiter were disruptive and detracted from our overall enjoyment.

{"id":805,"text":"The Park House is a great place to drink. They have a very good beer selection and even though the kitchen is a 4 foot by 4 foot square behind the bar the food is really good. \\n\\nThey have all you can eat Popcorn and Peanuts so you will never be in want of something to snack on while drinking your favorite beer. \\n\\nThey have live bands several times a week my favorite being Tuesdays which often features local Blue Grass musicians. \\n\\nThe down side to this place for me is that it's a little on the expensive side. They have a majority of their beers that are 6+ bucks a pint which a bit much. You can get some for $4.50 - $5 but it cuts your selection significantly. It definitely makes you think twice before going here often. I just wish all their beers were under $5 because I would probably try and go here more often. \\n\\nOver all it's a great bar the owner is a nice guy and you're going to have a great time.","label":"human"}

To conduct such service in an environment, where everyone is either drunk or not from there... is impressive. I wouldn't recommend this place for big groups. When my friend had made the reservation for us, and they said the limit was 5 -- that seemed to make sense. The environment is intimate, cozy and there is a lot of noise.\\n\\nThe place itself is nice, I love the decor... it's warm woods, make it sexy and the way that it opens up into the hotel is nice. It doesn't close you off from the hustle and bustle that is the Bellagio... and ultimately, that is Vegas.\\n\\nWhere I run into trouble is the actual menu itself. It's kind of boring. The food, I feel is art here. But more like paint running down a wall. I was uninspired and slightly sober... so I still hold true to that. And that is the point of Vegas, if you eat more than you drink... something is to be said. So ultimately, you don't get your fix.\\n\\nThere was a wide array at the table. Lobster tacos were $22, and came into very small finger size tacos served on a metal rack. Pizza was tapas size which ran $18. Kobe Sliders with Fries runs $25. Filet runs $50 with no sides. For myself, I ordered like an anorexic -- because I had just swallowed a buffet earlier in the day. I did the Fried Mac n' Cheese which was delectable and the Cucumber Essence martini was great. Total of that $24. And in true Vegas fashion, somehow $60 escaped me at this place.\\n\\nAll in all, I might come back. If I can let go of my inner fat girl and not surrender to my natural gluttony. Because, when I sit down to eat... I don't expect to feel helpless looking at the food coming out... I expect to feel slightly satisfied.","label":"human"}
{"id":811,"text":"Another disappointing experience at Living Spaces. I visited the Phoenix location to collect a coffee table and buy a painting. Right from the start, the sales manager Xan didn't greet me. When I asked her about my table, her response was dismissive. I had to clarify that I bought the table online and didn't set a pick-up date. After some time, she arranged it for me. While waiting, I bought a $200 painting but had to wait to pay as no one was free to assist me. The staff in the back were helpful and loaded everything for me. I got home and found my table was missing 4 screws. I called customer service but wasn't surprised to find they haven't improved. They suggested buying the screws elsewhere or waiting for 2 to 6 weeks. When I asked for free delivery due to the trouble, I was told it wasn't possible. I asked for a manager but was told none were available. Apparently, one would call back in 24 hours. I won't be buying from this company again. Save your time and shop elsewhere. Their products are available elsewhere. I'd rather pay more than deal with this terrible company. They've lost a $1000 sale due to poor customer service. I'll keep updating on the poor service I'm receiving.","label":"ai"}
{"id":812,"text":"I recently visited this establishment and I must say, I was extremely disappointed. The only redeeming factor was the pie, but even that couldn't make up for the overall subpar experience. First of all, let's talk about the atmosphere. It was nothing special, just a typical diner setting. The tables were cramped, making it difficult to have a comfortable meal. And speaking of meals, the menu options were limited and uninspiring. I expected more variety and creativity from a place that supposedly has a pastry-school-trained chef on pie duty. The service was also lackluster. While the staff was friendly, they were far from attentive. It took forever to get our orders taken and even longer for the food to arrive. And when it did finally come, it was lukewarm at best. It was clear that the kitchen staff lacked attention to detail and proper timing. Now, let's address the pie that everyone seems to rave about. Yes, it was large, but that's about the only positive thing I can say. The apple pie was overly sweet and lacked any depth of flavor. It was as if they had dumped a ton of sugar on top of a pile of apples. The crust was soggy and undercooked, which ruined the overall texture of the pie. Overall, I regret wasting my time and money at this establishment. The lackluster atmosphere, mediocre service, and disappointing pie left a sour taste in my mouth. I would advise anyone considering a visit to think twice and save yourself the disappointment. There are definitely better options out there.","label":"ai"}

{"id":816,"text":"I was more disappointed in this stay than I have ever been with a hotel. It was the worst value considering the service- at $445 a night for a simple, basic room, when our economy is in a recession and hotel trends are weakening, I expect friendly and prompt service AT A MINIMUM. I found the conceirge to be confused, give us poor directions (i.e. taking 30 mins to get somewhere that took 5 minutes), recommended a terrible restaurant to us (Los Olivos) that was completely unsuitable, and never letting us know our folio of reservations and most importantly, NOT LETTING US KNOW WHEN she had been unable to make reservations that she suggested. \\n\\nThe construction at the deck right above the pool was also an issue - no one had notified us of. The jackjammering started at 915 AM on Friday. The manager did give us a $100\/night rate abatement after I had to complain - which I appreciated but would have preferred to not have the conversation in the first place. \\n\\nThe room was also dirty - our feet kept turning black and we couldnt figure out why - and we were utterly disgusted to realize it was from our HOTEL ROOM.

{"id":817,"text":"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Ginza, and despite a few hiccups with the service, I must say that the food and overall experience were still enjoyable. Upon arriving at the restaurant, I found myself in a bit of a bind after locking my keys inside my apartment. Despite this initial inconvenience, I was looking forward to a delicious meal at Ginza, as I had always found the service to be solid in the past. I placed my order for the House Salad, Gyoza, and Sweet Potato Roll, and eagerly awaited my meal. However, I encountered a few issues with the service during my visit. The server, MARGRET, seemed to be the only staff member on duty, and there was some miscommunication regarding my order. Despite this, I appreciated her efforts to accommodate my requests. There were some misunderstandings with my order, as the server initially forgot to bring out my House Salad. However, when the salad was eventually brought to my table, I decided that I no longer wanted it. Unfortunately, the server seemed flustered and appeared to be somewhat annoyed by my request to cancel the salad. As I enjoyed my Gyoza, the Sweet Potato Roll was brought to my table before I had finished my first dish. I had to remind the server that I was still eating, and she quickly took away my nearly finished Gyoza. Despite these minor interruptions, I found the quality of the food to be excellent. In terms of the service, I did find it to be somewhat lacking. The server seemed a bit rushed and pushy, and there were moments when I felt like my needs as a customer were not being fully addressed. However, I do believe that with the right training and support, the staff at Ginza could greatly improve the overall customer experience. In conclusion, while I did encounter some challenges with the service at Ginza, I cannot deny that the food was delicious and the atmosphere was pleasant. I hope that the restaurant will take steps to address these service issues, as I would love to continue dining at Ginza in the future.","label":"ai"}
{"id":818,"text":"I must respectfully disagree with the previous review. My experience at this establishment was nothing short of delightful. I visited for lunch and while the revolving feature was not functioning, I was pleasantly surprised by the extensive menu provided. From appetizers to sushi, udon, ramen, fried rice, and dessert, there was something for everyone. The best part? It was all available for an incredibly reasonable price of $11.95. We indulged in a variety of appetizers, mostly consisting of fried and breaded items, which greatly pleased the children in our group. The sushi was a highlight, as it was beautifully fresh and flavorful. Although the udon portion was slightly lacking in noodles, it still satisfied our cravings. The standout of the meal was undoubtedly the green tea ice cream, which was absolutely divine. Admittedly, the fried bananas were a bit over-breaded, but that was a minor flaw. While the service was a tad slow, with only one sushi chef and occasional mix-ups in our orders due to a language barrier, it did not detract significantly from the overall experience. I would certainly consider returning, if only to indulge in the heavenly green tea ice cream once again.","label":"ai"}

As a waitress myself, I understand the challenges of the service industry, and I was impressed with the casual, laid-back atmosphere here. Despite only a few tables being occupied, the staff made sure to maintain an efficient and relaxed service. Our server had a unique approach of popping her head around the corner to check on us, which added a touch of charm and personality. We were pleasantly surprised when other staff members delivered our food, giving us the opportunity to interact with more members of the friendly team. Speaking of food, it was an absolute delight. The pasookie was flawlessly prepared as always, and the wings, though they could have used a bit more sauce, were quite satisfying. Our server's laid-back style, which involved using her phone during service, was a refreshing change from the usual formalities.

Nevertheless, the food was fantastic, and I am looking forward to dining here again.","label":"ai"}
{"id":823,"text":"The hotel suite was amazing since its roomy and clean at first. The management was horrible as the unit is owned by Jet Luxury Resort. First at check in they forgot to transfer our reservation to the hotel so we had to wait 30 minutes just to check in while our taxi was waiting outside charging us. Then the cleanliness was a disappointment. The housekeeping staff member came in who couldn't speak English. She did not make the bed or clean the washroom or the room. She changed the towels and garbage can. We tried communicating with her about cleaning the room, but she had no response. We called the manager and we were accussed of lying about finding our reservation during checkin in for 30 minutes. Management also showed no sympathy for our frustration as we stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and not a single day the hotel was cleaned. The 4rth night after much complaints to the manager, a housekeeper was sent to clean the room, and once again they changed the towels and garbage and left without cleaning the room. Our room was filthy with dirty washroom, dust and unwiped tables and kitchen counters. It was an extremely inconvenient part of the trip since we had to call the manager 3 times and there was nothing done to accomodate for the poor service. Our tv remote control was not working and the manager completely ignored the complaint and instead of accused us that most people try to take advantage by complaining so they can't do anything to accomodate. The MGM Signature hotel themselves apologized numerous time on behalf of Jet Luxury Resort and tried to accomodate us. \\n\\nFor future, I will never recommend or book with Jet Luxury. Instead book directly with the hotel. It's better to have good service and pay more than go through poor management and horrible customer service. \\n\\nOh, just to add, their sales representative \\\"Josh\\\" is a horrible worker.

After four and a half hours of salon\/employee improvement and makeover \\\"reality\\\" TV I can say that this nail salon could definitely stand some Tabatha type attention. \\n It wasn't as awful as some of the previous reviews, the lady who did my nails was quiet and seemed to stay generally focused - aside from having to answer the phone every time it rang. I didn't wait very long before she started on my pedicure and she listened to what I wanted (just filing my nails - no clipping.) The massage chairs work on the bottom and back; there's a lot going on there if you want it, or you can adjust using the controls. She did a fine job on my toes. \\n My major complaint comes as we moved over to the manicure. The tables were gross!! I wanted to ask for a sponge and some lysol to start cleaning myself. The manicure tables were dirty and small. Another customer commented on the cramped space and someone mentioned that they would be getting new tables soon. I can only hope that someone might be bothered to keep the layer of grime off the new ones, but I doubt it. \\n Grand total for the experience was $55 for the mani-pedi.

{"id":836,"text":"Based on my single visit to this establishment, I would rate the food a mediocre 5 out of 10. While the sushi was far from the best I've ever had, I must admit that the creme puffs were surprisingly delicious, although I suspect they were just store-bought from Costco. The service, on the other hand, was slightly better, earning a 6 out of 10. However, the staff seemed incapable of determining when we had finished eating, resulting in a slow and frustrating payout process. This is particularly disappointing during lunchtime when quick table turnovers are essential for those needing to return to work promptly. The atmosphere, scoring a 7 out of 10, offered a unique experience where patrons can select covered dishes from a conveyor belt circling the restaurant. While apparently common in Japan, it was a novelty for me. Moreover, the affordable price range of $1 to $2 per item allowed for the freedom to try various dishes that caught my attention. In terms of value, I would rate it an 8 out of 10. The inexpensive pricing of the items certainly adds to the appeal, making it a budget-friendly option for those seeking a quick sushi fix. Overall, while this establishment may not excel in terms of sushi quality or efficient service, it does offer a distinctive experience with its conveyor belt system. However, for a truly satisfying sushi meal, it may be wise to explore other options.","label":"ai"}

And to top it off, the cheese didn't even cover the whole bread. Man, I hate to sound mean, but I'm just so let down. The last time I came here, the food was awesome, but this time it felt like they just threw it together. Come on, cooks, show some love for your grub! :\/","label":"ai"}
{"id":842,"text":"Lucas is great if you work downtown and you're having a rough day that requires working through your lunch break. Call, place your order and your food will arrive within the hour. \\n\\nIt's the only place downtown that has been consistent with delivery times and quality of food (outside of ordering pizza). It's not the GREATEST lunch spot in the downtown area, especially with the emergence of new, and fabulous, lunch spots (like Le Thai and Eat...) but it's definitely my go-to delivery spot. \\n\\nI almost always order a salad (greek or caesar) and have never had any problems. Salads come with dressing on the side and a bread roll. Really tasty, in my opinion. My only qualm is they tend to over-charge, especially if you want to substitute anything or add meat to your salad. \\n\\nI've ordered the Reuben and BLT in the past - not bad! They've got decent french fries and one of my co-workers really loves their empanadas. \\n\\nThe menu is huge so you shouldn't have trouble finding something that catches your eye. Although, I advise against ordering any of the soups because they lack flavor.\\n\\nAlso, there's an AYCE salad bar if you chose to sit and eat rather than have it delivered. I've never actually been to Luca's, but this is what I hear around the water cooler!","label":"human"}
{"id":843,"text":"Overall, a solid experience at this establishment. The Guinness and Guinness stew were enjoyable, and the Sheppard's pie left my wife satisfied. The portion sizes were generous, with the fish and chips being particularly large. The value for the price in Vegas is good, and there is a nice selection of beers. My only suggestion would be to use real mashed potatoes in the dishes. Overall, a 4 out of 5.","label":"ai"}

Wine list is outrageous - a little disappointing for those who don't want to spend $60 a bottle. I had the Gemelli, which was really good - great flavor with fabulous homemade pasta and crisp broccoli rabe. My husband had the spaghetti and meatballs - nothing too crazy - well prepared meatballs with homemade pasta and savory tomato sauce.

{"id":846,"text":"Driving through the sweltering heat I occasionally see a set of billboards for the M Resort stating \\\"BEST---RATED---BUFFET---IN VEGAS\\\". One could not help but contain themselves after trekking so far off the strip.\\n We got there around just around 1pm, just barely beating the lunch rush. Despite that. our wait in line was still 45 minutes, and a that point I didn't know if I was hungry any more (pretty sure it was the result of standing next a guy who's B.O. nearly caved me and my friends in).\\nWe finally get our table and was waited on by one of the cheeriest fellows I've ever met, if you've met him make sure to tip well. I grab a couple plates and check out there \\\"foods of the word\\\" themed lay out and honestly not to much looked enticing. Non the less I grab a little of everything and come to like the \\\"southern\\\" portion of the buffet. I loved there fried mushrooms, uber-sweet mashed yams and the fat hunks of ribs they had on display. I swelled in content as I able get my guilty pleasure off their fast-food style \\\"Asian\\\" section, chow-mein I have missed you. Their dessert section was a bit lackluster save for the Gelato portion, Pistachio is a must try. \\nSide note: be aware of their Rum Raisin, it literally taste like there's a shot of rum it! Not something you want to be reminded of after a night of partying, but if you want to get a cheap buzz then by all means get gelato-wasted!\\nOverall the buffet is so-so, the price was right (lunch $15.99) so I''m not complaining. I guess the let down came from all the hype from the banners I saw along the way to Vegas and I guess I missed their popular Seafood Section, a result of coming on a Friday. In the end it's too much of a drive if your staying on the strip.","label":"human"}
{"id":847,"text":"R.I.P. Salads N' Such... if you're looking for the Salads N' Such that you used to know and love, this ain't it.\\n\\nThis used to be a lot of peoples' favorite sandwich shop in Mesa. New owners recently moved in and unfortunately the only thing that has carried over is the name and a fraction of the menu--most of which tastes nothing like it used to!\\n\\nFor starters, the service has been really bad. On my first trip to the newly managed place my order was at first lost, then I was overcharged (which they thankfully fixed, but took almost 5 minutes), and then my sandwich was made incorrectly (a take out, so I got to drive 15 minutes back to correct it, with nothing more than a \\\"sorry\\\" to boot).\\n\\nOn my most recent trip I got the same thing I had been getting for years and the bread was stale--this from a place that was famous for its fresh toasted rolls--the potato salad was mostly clumps of mayonnaise, the lettuce and tomato were both soggy and aged, and the cookies--which also used to be fresh made--tasted like something from a prepackaged box from the 99 cent store next store. \\n\\nI took the sandwich back, no refund needed. The new owners claim to have attempted to update the restaurant and learn from the \\\"old guard\\\" that was here, but it's a pale reproduction.

Her toes looked absolutely horrible! My 3 year old little cousin could have done a better job! You should be embarassed! The worst I have ever seen:( Anyways, A different lady that was doing the bday girls manicure completely ignored what she wanted and just did it to match her pedicure! She said \\\"same color but a fade not french!\\\" Everyone heard her saying it over & over. She wanted a pink glitter fade! This is not how you do business! You dont pretend you dont understand! You listen!! You should have fixed them, but you did it your way!! Im not done, theres more!.... My lady made me turn off my spa chair bcuz she couldn't polish my toes with it on! WTHeck? Then you shouldn't be doing pedicures missy!! Anyways ladies, you just lost 2 good customers... plus all the ones we tell just how awful your service was today. We will never be back!!

Not the fanciest, but not the ugliest Thai place I've been to.\\n\\nThe food, however, is out of this world! I'm not too picky about Thai food, but I can tell Lotus of Siam knows their Thai flavors very very very well. Everything tasted fresh and flavorful. My favorite dish was nam kao tod. I only ordered it because of the Yelp reviews, and I'm so glad I did!!!!! The flavors are so indescribable... I just wish the portion was bigger because the 4 of us was fighting over it, haha! The rice is crispy with a nice crunch to it and it has a sour lime taste, combined with small pieces of sausages or whatever the heck it was that made this dish so amazing.\\n\\nWe ordered a bunch of other things... tom yum hot pot, pad thai, soft shell crabs pad kee mao, some curry dish, fried rice, and I forgot the rest.

{"id":858,"text":"I don't know why this always happens to my mom, but she seem to have the worst of luck at places like this. Unfortunate situations always occur to her when she is just minding her own business. She was just standing near the pool and watching the dolphins play when two of the male dolphins began to fight. The fight was so violent that both dolphins landed on the cement and began aggressively hitting there tails at each other. This was less than 2 feet away from my mom. My mom and another woman ran for their lives. Both dolphins were cut and bloody due to the severe fight, and flopped back into the water to continue the fight. The staff didn't say sorry and just explained to her and the other woman that male dolphins fight over territory. Of course it ruined my mom's trip. She came here to relax because the night before she got a phone call that informed her that her Dad had died. I should have brought her to the Mandalay Bay Shark thing. \\nThe day just got worse at the Tiger and Lion exhibit. One of the tigers decided to take a piss towards the crowd of people watching. I had no clue that a tiger could piss that far of a distance. The people all ran backwards, but thought it was funny. They were laughing because it missed them, but I bet if it actually hit them they would be pissed off as hell. \\n\\nSo, I guess this place ain't 100% safe. So my advice is to hold onto your young children, and don't let them get too close to the dolphin tanks. \\n\\nIf management is reading this and thinks I am exaggerating, go check out the security tape and see for yourself.

{"id":862,"text":"I had a terrible experience at this restaurant. The decor and ambiance were nice, but that's about the only positive thing I can say. The server, Carlos, was rude and inattentive. He seemed more interested in chatting with the other staff than in providing good service to us. The bread they brought to our table was stale and unappetizing, definitely not what I expected from a supposedly high-end restaurant. The main course was a huge disappointment. I ordered the \"A Tasting of New York Sirloin\" for a whopping $140, and while the steaks were decent, they were nowhere near worth the price. The Japanese Wagyu was the best out of the three, but even that was not as good as I had hoped. The sides were bland and lacked flavor. The whole meal left much to be desired, especially for the high price point. The portions were small, and the prices were exorbitant. The fact that they only give 2 oz. of the Japanese Wagyu at such a high price feels like a complete rip-off. I left feeling unsatisfied and disappointed. It's clear that this place is only concerned with making a profit and not with providing a quality dining experience. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone, especially for special occasions. Save your money and go somewhere else where you can get a better meal and service. I will definitely not be returning to this establishment.","label":"ai"}

{"id":864,"text":"In a nutshell... boring.\\n\\nFor some reason my friends like to come to this place and I've been several times so this review is actually a culmination of all my experiences.\\n\\nFor starters, ever time I come here they only have one server. I'd like to say the service is terrible but that wouldnt be fair because there's only one person handling the whole restaurant. The real key here is that the management\/owners (whatever) don't ever get up off their asses and help out when the poor girl is swamped. Look around, you'll see lots of parched people sitting in front of empty glasses.\\n\\nAnd speaking of management, don't think about bringing a kid here unless you're interested in dirty looks from the old hostess. Believe me I hate kids in restaurants too but it's 6:00pm and if it wasn't for my friend and his kids eating these mediocre $20 pizzas the place would be dead so sweetheart, yes, you with the grimace, lighten up. You're bringing the whole dining experience down.\\n\\nAnd speaking of down. I've seen several, several, several kids spill full cups of milk on the floor in this place because the owners refuse to stock plastic cups with lids and straws for the kids. You can find stupid metallic covers for your goofy menus but can't stock a lid. Talk about being obstinant.\\n\\nOK, on to the food. Not bad, not great. Not quite convinced it's Tuscan but if you're lost in North Scottsdale and can't find Grimaldis and you stumble into this place you'll walk away with a mediocre Italian meal.","label":"human"}

Took my husband here for a little breakfast date. Yes, we actually set the alarm and went here around 9AM. Love the donuts and the donut prices. Love that they have coolattas and pumpkin-spiced coffee near Halloween. Love the selection of donuts. I just wish the coffee prices were a little less and that's all that's keeping me from giving it 5 stars. Love the breakfast but I think you should get two breakfast wraps for a buck, not just one.

{"id":878,"text":"The size of the servings is almost immoral. There is a $3 charge for sharing, which if you come to think about it, would not make it a bad deal if you both happen to want to partake of the same disgusting sandwich. The quality of the food and its size are in inverse proportion; our meat was dry, tasteless, visually revolting, anchored by two slivers of bread to justify calling it a sandwich and not a chunk of dead dry beef. The worst sin was the chicken soup, that traditional icon of soothing relief; yellow liquid with a taste of having recently sprinkled or dissolved from an envelop or a cube, sodium being the preponderate flavor. \\nCan't believe the place is so popular, but in Las Vegas everything is possible, I guess.","label":"human"}
{"id":879,"text":"Back for breakfast today and unfortunately The Groves did not exceed my expectations enough to get four stars again. The $3.95 breakfast sign in front is definitely a bait and switch tactic because there is only one item I saw on the menu for that price and the rest was pretty expensive for what you got, or at least as high as anywhere else (no deal here). French toast came with a ball of butter as big as a golf ball and a lot of powdered sugar with a sticky syrup container along side. Nothing special but it tasted ok. \\nSusan's omelet was pretty flavorless and the potatoes tasted like they had been fried in something strange or they were just starting to go bad. She told me \\\"you wouldn't like this.\\\"\\n\\nOur previous lunch was very good and we were looking forward to going back for breakfast. The waitress even said everyone comes in here for breakfast??? We must be missing something here. Maybe we just ordered the wrong things. Not sure about another visit.

Couldn't tell ya what vibe they were aiming for, but I could hardly see my mates, let alone my grub. Asked for a candle and got told they were having electrical issues so an open flame was a no-go. Made us real eager to stick around, that... The food was just alright, nothing to write home about. I'm an old school kinda guy so I went for the Carbonara (big shocker). Turned out it was pretty bland. Honestly, it wasn't worth the extra gym time. My mate swore she saw something dark darting across the floor at one point. The place looked clean enough and was well-organized, but something was off. I'm kinda wary about slagging off Inca since it's always packed. They must be doing something right.

{"id":884,"text":"After a brief hiatus, we decided to return to our old favorite Tropicana Pizza. It was quite nostalgic to be welcomed back by the same team. We opted for our classic order, the chicken fingers special meal deal and pizza. We were informed that the delivery would take around 30 to 40 minutes, which was a bit longer than we expected, but we were eager to revisit the taste of Tropicana. The order arrived slightly over the promised time, however, we were pleasantly surprised to find an additional side of fries accompanying our chicken fingers. The chicken fingers, though we counted only 5 or 6, were cooked to perfection and the small portion of fries added a nice touch. We did have a minor mix up with our order, and we quickly communicated our concerns to the restaurant. The person on the other end was understanding, and promptly sent out a new order which arrived in around 35 to 40 minutes. There was a bit of a misunderstanding regarding the pricing, but we were more than happy to pay an additional $15 for the revised order. We did have a discussion with Tropicana Pizza about the situation, and while the person on the other end held their stance, we appreciated their commitment to the business. While some might find these circumstances off-putting, we found ourselves reminiscing about the old Tropicana Pizza days. We recommend Tropicana Pizza to those who appreciate an establishment with a long-standing history and are willing to overlook minor hiccups for the sake of delicious pizza and chicken fingers!","label":"ai"}

The food arrived when the dang Bloody Mary still had ice, like seriously? And don't even get me started on their nonexistent poached eggs. Probably afraid they'll turn into fossils!

{"id":888,"text":"I absolutely love this place for their amazing burgers! Every time I come back, I can't resist ordering one of their delicious burgers and their fries are just as mouth-watering. The food is always on point and I have never been disappointed. However, I have to agree with some of the other reviews that the drinks can be a hit or miss. It's a bit surprising for a brewery to have subpar drinks, but I think they might be trying too hard to be unique. I've had some warm beers and some cocktails that just didn't hit the mark. In fact, one of the cocktails I tried was the worst drink I've ever had. My husband couldn't even stomach it. However, I noticed that it wasn't on the menu during my last visit, so perhaps they realized it wasn't up to par. I also ordered a margarita, thinking it would be a safe choice, but it turned out to be a unique twist that didn't quite suit my taste. On top of that, the timing of their live performances can be a bit off, as the sound was turned off during a game night. It's great that they support local performers, but it might be better to choose between sports or live performances on certain nights. Despite these issues, I still give this place 4 stars because their food is just that good. I'll definitely be back for the burgers and fries, but I'll be avoiding the drinks from now on. Overall, I highly recommend this place for the food alone.","label":"ai"}
{"id":889,"text":"MHI is this fancy-schmancy mansion up on Pinckney with a killer view of the Capitol and the city. We went there for a 4th of July weekend and let me tell ya, the prices were through the roof. I'm not sure it was worth it, but I checked out their regular rates and they seem more reasonable. Although, I gotta say, they still seem more like Chicago prices than Madison prices to me. When we got there, we had to ring a doorbell to get in every time. No keys for us guests, and there's always someone there to let you in. The place was super fancy inside, with a cool bar and sitting area, a lounge with a fireplace, and our room was this English basement style. Not a whole lotta light, but it had all the fancy stuff - nice sheets, fancy bath products, heated bathroom floor, and even terry cloth robes. Plus, a big ol' picture of Lance Armstrong, of all people. Turns out, Trek the bike company owns the place, so there's biking pics all over the joint. The bed was like sleeping on a cloud, and we didn't hear a peep from anyone else staying there. The staff were really nice and made us feel right at home in the lounge, with endless nuts and candy and a continental breakfast on the deck. The whole place was decked out in marble, wood, and restored tile, with a cool circular staircase in the middle. Our room was quiet, but it was a bit dark and gloomy. They talked us into it because it was bigger, but next time I'd go for a lighter room over a few extra square feet. Overall, MHI is a swanky spot with killer views and a fancy vibe. I'd say it's worth checking out, just maybe not for a holiday weekend when they jack up the prices. But if you're looking for a fancy-pants stay in Madison, this could be the spot for you.","label":"ai"}
{"id":890,"text":"My family and I finally gave in to my wife's desire to visit this restaurant after seeing it on DDD. The restaurant itself was clean, but there were only two tables filled during our visit. Unfortunately, the service was incredibly slow as my youngest had to wait 45 minutes for her chicken wings, which arrived long after the rest of us had finished eating. As for the food, I had ordered the nachos grande and was disappointed to find that the meat was cold, the cheese was not melted, and the guacamole was watery. My other family members all ordered beef chimichangas, and my oldest even questioned if the meat was real. My son even offered to trade his chimichanga with my nachos, but it turned out to be equally unpleasant. Overall, the dining experience was highly unsatisfactory, and I would rather have skipped the meal and gone straight to bed. I have no intention of returning to this restaurant and I hope that the staff member from DDD who recommended it gets reassigned to a desk job.","label":"ai"}

Unfortunately the card reader wasn't working so the man behind the counter asked if I could go get cash. The nearest ATM is in the Smiths across the way. I went and got cash (paying an extra $3 since it wasn't my bank) and went back. There was no one else in the place at the time and the same man behind the counter saw me come in. I had my cash out and my food was bagged and sitting on the counter but instead of helping me he decided to take a personal phone call on his cell while I stood there and stared at him. I continued to wait for several minutes and another man was at the counter doing something and also ignoring me. Finally he looked up and asked if he could help me. I said I'd like to pay for my food. At which time the other man finally got off his phone and took my money. No apology, no offer to give me a discount for my inconvenience, or even just throw in extra fortune cookies or something. \\nThe food was decent (wor wonton soup, house fried rice, and orange chicken) but it is definitely not worth going all the way over there for terrible service.

{"id":893,"text":"I recently had an extended (nearly three week) stay here for business. I think it's safe to say that in that amount of time, you can get a much better idea of a hotel rather than the \\\"snapshot\\\" that a normal overnight traveler might get.\\n\\nFirst, let me get the complaining out of the way:\\n- The AC in the rooms has a sensor unit that turns it off when you're out of the room for an extended period. This is good for the environment (and the hotel's power bill), but not for someone who is gone for business eight hours per day in August and then returns to find their room to be in the 90 degree range until the AC can catch up after flicking back on.\\n- The (front desk) staff ranges anywhere from extremely friendly to somewhat scary. Your luck will prevail against other factors in this regard.\\n- Many days, the housekeeping service seemed to run very late. Even if I returned to my room for the day after 4pm, my room would sometimes still not be cleaned.\\n- There aren't any stores except one convenience store within easy walking distance (closest is about 3\/4 mile).\\n\\nThat being said, there were good points:\\n- The free WiFi worked flawlessly, very fast and no connectivity problems\\n- The pool area was a definite treat during the 100 degree+ days, at least for the short amount of time one could stay out there\\n- Laundry available in the hotel for a reasonable price ($2 per load to wash and dry)\\n- Nice fitness facility\\n- Very close to Gateway Airport\\n\\nOverall, I'm sure you could do much worse in Mesa. I wasn't in love, but I have certainly stayed in many places that made the Legacy look like a palace.","label":"human"}

It's a feature I wish all pho places offered! The broth has become a bit sweeter and the meat less tender, but it's still a satisfying meal. What surprised me on my recent visit was the renovated interior, which now has a modern and clean ambiance. The new cushiony sofa-like chairs in bright red and sleek black tables are a vast improvement.

I took it back right away. The second time I got my car, the bumper was off and it rattled. They fixed the bumper but said the rattle was normal for an \"older\" car. I didn't buy it. I went to Firestone and they found the issue with the plates and fixed it for free. I also told Sterling about the engine shake, but they said it was normal and would go away. My mechanic found a crack in a motor mount. After weeks of back and forth, it's finally fixed. Dealing with Sterling was so frustrating. They didn't care about my concerns.

No contest. If you're into pork, you gotta try this at Mastro's. And the side sauce, man, walnuts, apples and what tasted like a hint of bourbon? It was like a match made in heaven for that pork chop. Seriously tasty. The hubby went for the Chilean Sea Bass, which he said was cooked just right and really good. I ain't a fish fan so I can't vouch for that, but the guy licked his plate clean. We shared some broccoli florets, kinda garlicky, which he loved but I could take 'em or leave 'em. I did spot a few yellow bits on the broccoli which ain't cool for a top-notch joint like this. Also noticed the salad tomatoes still had their tops on - not cool either. We ended with a fudge cake, pretty good but didn't beat the chocolate sin cake we had last time. Still, it was decent. Place was heaving on a Tuesday night.

{"id":930,"text":"I was extremely disappointed with my stay at Caesar's Palace. Despite its reputation, the hotel did not live up to its hype. The common areas, lounges, and casino floors were not as upscale as I expected. Even though we had an updated room in the newer tower, it still didn't make up for the underwhelming casino and tacky common areas. The customer service was also lacking, which is something you would expect from any hotel in the US. In comparison, the Bellagio, Wynn\/Encore, and Planet Hollywood all offered cheaper rooms and a much better experience. Caesar's Palace felt more like a 3-star hotel, especially if you stay in the Roman tower rooms. The poor guest service, outdated casino areas, and unpleasant smell really bring the overall experience down. The place reeks of cigar smoke and an unpleasant air freshener. The sports book is also lacking. If the prices were lower, it might be a reasonable place to stay, but for the price we paid, we could have booked the Bellagio and enjoyed true luxury. Our check-in experience was also terrible, with a long wait and a lack of efficiency. The hotel staff showed little concern for our experience and seemed to assume that everyone was getting a free room. Overall, Caesar's Palace is a rip-off. There are many other casino hotels on the strip that offer higher quality, better customer service, and comparable or cheaper prices.","label":"ai"}

There were four in our party and the items we ordered were: mint pesto lamb chops, hummus platter, iceberg wedge salad, diver scallops, meatloaf, new york strip, chicken with the asiago creamed spinach and fingerling potatoes. We also had a great bottle of cabernet suggested by the server (I forgot the name, however, but it was one of their specialty wines). We also had pre-dinner cocktails and I had their Mai-Tai. It was one of the best I've ever had. The food was very good quality and not too salty. The only complaint by some of our party members were that the lamb did not have enough mint flavor (I don't eat lamb so I did not try them). The iceberg wedge did not have enough carmelized onions or blue cheese dressing and crumbles. We had to ask for extra blue cheese and were charged an extra fee. These are the only reasons for the four stars. Overall a good experience. It would have been better if Eddie visited our table. He was there and visited with most of the tables but not ours.

It's not too stuffy, but it's not too laid-back either. And it's not too loud, so you can actually have a conversation without yelling. I love that.\\n\\nNow let's talk about the wine. They've got a huge selection, mostly Italian, and let me tell you, they are all top-notch. If you're feeling fancy, definitely splurge on one of their sparkling or dessert wines. You won't regret it, I promise.\\n\\nAnd the food? Oh my goodness, it's out of this world. Even something as simple as cheese and cold cuts blew me away. The ingredients are so fresh and unique, it's like nothing you can find at your average grocery store. And the flavors? Unbelievable. They must marinate their olives and other foods themselves, because the taste is just next level.\\n\\nThe pasta dishes are a must-try. I had a few different ones and each one was a total winner. The sauces they pair with the pasta are something else. You can really taste all the different flavors, and it just works so well with the pasta. It's definitely inspired me to get more creative with my own pasta dishes at home.\\n\\nI had the calamari a while back, and I can't quite remember the details, but I do know it was absolutely delicious.\\n\\nThe service was on point. The food came out super quick, and the servers were on top of everything. They kept our drinks filled and cleared our plates without any issues.\\n\\nNow, let's talk about the price. It's a bit on the pricey side, I won't lie. But for the quality of the food and the portion sizes, it's definitely worth it. Maybe not an everyday spot, but perfect for those special occasions.","label":"ai"}

{"id":952,"text":"I recently visited this establishment and overall, I had a great time. I would give it a solid three stars for a few key reasons. Firstly, I absolutely loved the setup of the club with three different dance floors. The smallest one, which seemed to cater to a slightly older crowd, played old school rap and 90's R&B, which my friends and I really enjoyed. It was a refreshing change from the usual club music and made for a great atmosphere. Secondly, I appreciated the diversity of the crowd. It was clear that everyone was there to have a good time, and the energy was infectious. The bartenders and security guard also stood out to me - they were all incredibly friendly and added to the overall positive experience during the first part of our night. Unfortunately, there were a couple of downsides that prevented me from giving a higher rating. The main issue was the massive crowd. While it's great to see so many people out and enjoying themselves, the club was so packed that it became difficult to move around. It was uncomfortable and made it hard to fully enjoy the experience. Additionally, the music on the main dance floor, while initially enjoyable, became repetitive and didn't quite live up to the standard set by the smaller room. Despite these drawbacks, I still had an enjoyable time overall. The drinks, while a bit pricey, were well-made and tasty. However, I don't think I would return due to the overcrowding and the issues with the music. It's a shame because there were definitely aspects of the club that I really liked, but the negatives ultimately outweighed the positives for me. That being said, I think it's worth experiencing this establishment at least once. It's like any other club in many ways, but it has its own unique charm. The quirky addition of women bathing in tubs on the stage added an interesting touch, although it may not be to everyone's taste. Ultimately, while I may not rush back to this club, I can appreciate what it has to offer for those who enjoy a lively, energetic atmosphere.","label":"ai"}
{"id":953,"text":"I was extremely disappointed with my experience at Albertsons in Las Vegas. Having grown up with Albertsons in Texas, I was excited to shop at one again when I moved to LV. However, this location was severely lacking in many aspects. First of all, the store was old and dirty, and it was not well stocked or well staffed. The prices on non-sale items were also ridiculously high compared to other stores in the city. During my visit, I encountered only one cashier, Toni, who was openly complaining about her job and the customers. It was unprofessional and off-putting to witness this behavior. Additionally, many items that were advertised as on sale were either out of stock or in low supply, such as the store's brand water and eggs. The produce section was also a mess, with a confusing layout and only three plastic bag stations, which were inconveniently spaced out. Furthermore, there was only one functional scale available, making it difficult to weigh my produce. It was clear that the store was not equipped to handle more than a few shoppers at a time. To make matters worse, the rotisserie chicken and sides area was hella-gross. The large pans with self-serve sides were broken down and filled with old, smelly water. Despite my better judgment, I purchased a rotisserie chicken for dinner, only to find that it was small, dry, and unappetizing. Overall, my experience at this Albertsons was extremely disappointing. I would not recommend this location to anyone, as it was dirty, poorly stocked, and had unprofessional staff. They need to make significant improvements in order to provide a satisfactory shopping experience.","label":"ai"}

I was along for the ride so I came in with an open mind. I ordered the vegetable beef stew special. It was pretty good, but I had never had fry bread before so I didn't have any expectations. \\n\\nMy biggest complaint would be that we asked for the desserts to go, and we had to go chase down the waitress and have her to bring them to us after we had finished eating our lunches. When they finally did come, they were made to eat at the restaurant so I had to ask the waitress again to have them packaged to go. I am guessing they made a fresh batch to go because it took a while. \\n\\nThe food was good but not to die for. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. And the interior of the place needs work. For a place that supposedly just moved into this location, it sure had a lot of broken tables and out of order bathrooms.","label":"human"}

My friend and I shared the Spicy Tuna Crunch and I devoured the Japanese Lasagna and the lobster\/crab roll alone as he isn't a big fan of any warm sushi.

The scramble itself was overly greasy considering what I ordered didn't contain any meat in it. Two major issues that arise are that for one the service was extremely slow, a turn around of 45 minutes from Hello to Goodbye, something they need to address since their customer base have flights to catch. The other issue is that my waitress Kristen was completely vacant and unfriendly which culminated into placing BDBB's into my no fly zone.","label":"human"}

{"id":961,"text":"After hearing rave reviews about Filibertos at work, I decided to give it a shot. Unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory. I visited this establishment on three separate occasions, both in person and through their drive-thru, and every time I was left utterly disappointed. The beans and rice, touted as their specialties, were absolutely revolting on two occasions. The chicken quesadillas were a disaster, trapped between two gigantic tortillas drowned in a sea of queso slop that barely resembled cheese. The chicken itself tasted like it had been canned and forgotten for years. To add insult to injury, instead of neatly placing sour cream and guacamole on the side, it was carelessly slathered on the inside, resulting in a sloppy mess. The flavors were so repugnant that I had no choice but to toss this expensive disaster in the bin. With a plethora of Mexican food options available, I strongly advise you to steer clear of this place. Trust me, Serrano's is a heavenly alternative compared to this culinary nightmare.","label":"ai"}
{"id":962,"text":"Lot 17 has a good selection of draft beers and above average bar food, especially the sweet potato fries. However, the TV selection for non-Pitt games leaves something to be desired, with the focus mainly on local sports.

{"id":963,"text":"It's the only place open serving hot food after 1am in the city centre.\\n\\nNow that I've finished listing any of this place's good points, let me start the much lengthier task of listing what's bad about it.\\n\\nFor one thing, why it calls itself a pizzeria I do not know. The only people who eat here are the barely-old-enough-to-drink chavs that stumble up from City at kicking-out time to spend their last fiver on junk food, only to then sit on the pavement and cry when they realise they now have no money for a taxi home.\\n\\nAnd for another thing, if you do find yourself in a situation where you need ('need' being the key word there) to get food from here in the wee hours the queue is always ridiculous. When I used to work in a nightclub I would pass this place on my way home, and on one occasion my grumbling tummy got the better of me. So I decided to wait in the queue. Twenty minutes later - by which time I could have been home - the queue still hadn't moved. In fact, all that had happened was the following...\\n1) 2 chav girls had a screaming row from opposite sides of the street\\n2) a chav guy peed in the adjacent doorway\\n3) a worryingly young-lookig chav girl drunkenly vomited in the same doorway a few minutes later.\\n\\nFunnily enough, at that point I gave up and walked home.

Nothing else was. The salsa was bland like ketchup and we asked for an extra Jalapeno and never got it. The \\\"Flautas\\\" rolled in flour tortillas were corn taquitos. The Green Chile Pork Chimi was filled with flavorless stew meat and was soggy. Had we not enjoyed our margaritas we probably would have not eaten and gone to Taco Bell. This is probably a good restaurant for Snow Birds with no palate, but for true Southwesterners it was horrible.","label":"human"}

{"id":976,"text":"My first Q'doba experience also happened to take place in Madison, WI where I would visit a good friend of mine while living in the Chicago area. This was back around '99-'00 or so, I believe, and I'd never experienced a Chipotle to compare it to. I really enjoyed it at the time, so much so that when I moved to Michigan I would occassionally drive almost an hour to get to the closest one. I was pretty psyched when the one on Rural opened up out here because Chipotle never sits right in my stomach (not that it necessarily stops me...but I always dread the impending doom that eating there brings). Unfortunately, this wasn't exactly the Q'doba I remembered, and it's just sorta average. I like the chicken, but the steak is blah. Queso is ok, but I've had much better. This is the one place where I actually enjoy the flavor of their green salsa, and I like the hot as well. No salsa complaints here. I usually end up spending just slightly less for my order here versus at Chipotle, which consists of three tacos, a drink, and chips and salsa (queso at the Q).","label":"human"}

The sauce it came with was so good, I could've eaten it with a spoon. But, man, the service was slow as molasses. We waited almost an hour for our food. The manager apologized though, and she was really nice about it. But when our food finally came, it was a letdown. My boyfriend's bison was drowned in this nasty brown sauce that made it taste gross. And my salmon pasta was good at first, but then it got too rich for my liking after a few bites. Plus, we were trying to enjoy our meal outside on the patio when this couple parked their jeep right next to us and their dogs wouldn't stop barking. Like, I love animals, but c'mon!

Well, since we were starvin', I settled for the Taco Al Carbon and the hubby went for the supposedly classic El Tradicional burrito. We chowed down like there was no tomorrow, but I gotta be honest, I miss those old soft chicken tacos they used to sling. Oh, and don't forget to grab some salsa, peeps! My personal faves are the Avocado Salsa and the slightly spicy Salsa Roja. All in all, it's still a solid spot to grab a quick bite, even though we're still getting used to their new menu options.

The only reason why I keep dragging myself back here is 'cause it's just down the road from my place. I'm employed at the Starbucks in Mandalay Bay next to the House of Blues, and yeah it ain't a corporate Starbucks, but we still uphold the same rules and principles. Every time I step foot into this Starbucks, it's like I'm invisible if it ain't jam-packed. When they finally get around to taking my order, they're usually mad rude or distracted doing stuff that ain't their job - like gabbing about their personal drama or how their shift is going. If I just order a single drink, it takes anywhere from 5 - 10 minutes, depending on how deep they're in their chit-chat. If I need milk from the condiment bar, it's usually gone off or there ain't any milk at all. And don't even get me started on the drive-thru. I've got about three rewards stacked up on my Starbucks cards 'cause every time I tell them I've got a reward, they just shrug it off and charge me the full whack anyway.

{"id":991,"text":"So, I made a reservation for me and my crew of 6 through Open Table for Restaurant Week. We were hyped to try out this spot and get our grub on. We ordered the appetizer sampler for 2 and, honestly, it was pretty good. The fish tacos, bacon wrapped bacon & eggs, and chicken pot pie nuggets were all on point, but the chicken pot pie nuggets were kinda lacking in flavor - like they needed a little extra something-something, ya feel? For our entrees, we got the crispy fried game hen, shrimp and grits, and niman skirt steak. They were just okay, nothing to write home about, except for the bacon wrapped bacon & egg app - that was a standout. But here's where things went south. Our sides took forever to come out, and when they did, we had to ask about them. And don't even get me started on the dessert options. The freshly baked cookies were good, but nothing to write home about. And then when the check came, we were hit with a bunch of extra fees we didn't even know about. Like, what the heck? They hit us with a restaurant week charity donation and an appetizer upcharge. And get this - the price they charged us was different from what was on the website. Like, what's up with that? I did my research and didn't see anything about these extra fees. I'm definitely not coming back here, and I won't be telling my friends to come either.

For your DIY needs, they have recipients and jars specially designed if you want to go all-natural and make your own medicine or beauty products.\\n\\nIf making your own tea for whatever ailment you may have doesn't tickle your fancy, you might dig their courses: they have anything from recognizing the herbs around you, to curing your pets using plants, I recently I noticed they offered \\\"how to make your own lipbalm\\\"! \\n\\nYou don't need to be sick to appreciate all the goodness they have there: they have a lovely selection of organic beauty products from Quebec including shampoo, moisturizer, scrubs, bath salts etc.. That or a simple freshly-made chai tea brew wins me over every time...","label":"human"}
{"id":994,"text":"I don't get the hype. It's definitely an Americanized sushi joint. Most things are fried, baked and\/or swimming in sauce....\\n\\nI enjoy sushi for the delicate flavors of fresh fish. The pieces of the rolls are HUGE, so you can't fit the entire piece in your mouth easily (that's what she said).\\n\\nIt'll do if I am in suburbia. But overall, there are better places.","label":"human"}
{"id":995,"text":"So, I'm not really the type of person who would normally step foot into a small, specialized music shop like Avalanche. But let me tell you, I'm a total music junkie and my iPod is practically glued to my hip. So, I finally decided to step out of my comfort zone and check this place out a few days ago. Let me start by saying, walking into Avalanche was like a breath of fresh air compared to those giant chain stores like HMV. The selection they had was pretty damn diverse, and the best part? The prices were actually reasonable, starting from dirt cheap. They even had some of the latest chart CDs and a wicked selection of vinyls and LPs. I'm definitely gonna swing by here for my next music fix. But, here's the thing, I did notice a couple of things during my visit. First off, there was absolutely no background music playing. I mean, come on, it's a music shop, right? I was expecting to be serenaded with some sick tunes while I browsed. And secondly, the dude working there was on the phone the whole time. The whole damn time. He even managed to serve a customer while still yapping away. I mean, I get it, maybe it was an important call, but seriously, put the phone down and take care of your customers, dude. But hey, these are just minor annoyances. The other folks who reviewed this place seem to be head over heels in love with it. Apparently, they're gonna be moving soon, according to the sign out front. But I'm pretty sure music lovers all over the city will still be able to enjoy Avalanche for a long time to come. And speaking of Avalanche, this place really rocks!","label":"ai"}
{"id":996,"text":"I gotta say, I had high hopes for this place. I'm a dreamer, you know? But man, I was nervous about the whole expansion and traffic situation. Still, I couldn't help but imagine all the amazing stuff this convenient spot could offer. A cozy wine bar, some Teeter vibes, a touch of Earthfare, and a dollop of WF. Sounds like a dream, right? Well, reality slapped me in the face when I stepped into this joint. This new HT feels like it's stuck in the past, like it should've been exciting two decades ago. Now? It's just a sad, outdated store with a freakin' annoying elevator. The whole vibe is as cold as ice, starting from those cheesy fruit pictures outside. Seriously, who thought that was a good idea? This neighborhood desperately needs a grocery store that's all about local and organic produce. And let's not forget about natural cleaning products like the Method brand. Oh, and meat and seafood from small companies that actually care about the animals and the earth. Is that too much to ask? Maybe the wine bar has some potential, especially when it's nice out and you can sit at those outdoor tables. Sure, you'll be overlooking The Intersection of Many Crashes, but hey, at least the wine might make up for it. I did meet this really nice gal who works there, though. She knows her stuff and is actually pleasant to chat with. Can't say the same for everyone up there, though. Some folks definitely need to work on their positive vibes. Kroger, if you're listening, take some notes from WF and EF when it comes to planning. We need atmosphere, we need selection, and we definitely need ethics. This neighborhood deserves better, and we're counting on you to deliver.","label":"ai"}
{"id":997,"text":"They rolled up 20 minutes late to our hour shindig, left a bunch of kiddos bummed out 'cause they couldn't get their faces painted. Tried ringing 'em up multiple times but no dice. No one even bothered to say sorry. Wish I'd peeped the reviews before, seems they're always on CP time. Can't say I'd vouch for 'em.","label":"ai"}
{"id":998,"text":"This relationship is heading in the wrong direction. My first date with Cupcake Delirium was at a Chow Down food truck rally. We got a salted caramel cupcake that was incredibly moist and syrupy in the middle which oozed all the way down into the rest of the cupcake. It was borderline too sweet, but I overlooked it because of the moistness and I appreciated the smaller size which fit into a non-tippable cup container. I thought perhaps this was a new contender for #1.\\n\\nOur second date was at a Yelp event where they graciously donated mexican chocolate and egg nog cupcakes. They were also good and pretty moist, but not as divinely moist as the first ones.\\n\\nOur third date was at another food truck rally where we got a mint chocolate and a peanut butter cup cupcake. The PB cup, predictably, was better than the chocolate mint, but the devils food cake used for the bottom was really dry and we both left saying they just tasted stale and totally disappointing. Maybe they're just not that into me? Or maybe she had a bad day.\\n\\nNevertheless, I'm not holding my breath for a fourth date. Perhaps I should give Southern Cake Queen a shot.","label":"human"}
{"id":999,"text":"Shakti is the bomb! They always have something cool, like a dope t-shirt or a rad candle. Their jewelry is super cute and doesn't break the bank. And they've got all the incense and books you could want. Just walking in there gives you the best vibe, man. Love it!","label":"ai"}
