{"id":2,"text":"> Deep learning-based image segmentation, in particular convolutional neural networks (CNN), achieves state-of-the-art performance with a well-performed network, large enough datasets, and strong data augmentation. Despite promising achievements, labeling all images in a dataset to train a CNN is time-consuming and even beyond human capability. In fact, labeling data in real-world scenes is very difficult and expensive. In order to obtain the segmentation model from a dataset with limited number of labels and augment it to be able to handle any new input data, a few-shot learning (FSL) method is considered here, where a fully-labeled source data and a few labeled target data are used for deep learning. FSL has been used in natural image segmentation. We utilize a semi-supervised learning technique to extend labeling a few samples in a target data to labeling a few samples in a source data. We evaluate our method on a dataset of the human lung CT images. ### Publication Details\nDate of publication:\nLink:\nWebsite","label":"ai"}

Cassandra is outnumbered in this family, because Professor Aisling lectures on myth and legends at his school, and believes in magical and mysterious things too. But some of the leaders of the faculty believe that it is useless to teach about tales and myths, because mysterious and supernatural things cannot be dissected, weighed and measured. One member in particular, Mr. Bilgewallow, takes pleasure in tormenting Professor Aisling, who wants, and dreams, of a voyage that will bring him to the worlds where he would see the creatures of legend. One day, his wish comes true. As he and his brothers walk across the shore, they come across a strange small boat, with a crew of dwarf and demons. One of the dwarf identifies himself as Malachi, Commander of H.M.S. Basset. He explains that it is Professor Aisling's boat, conjured from his wishes and willing to sail on the \"tides of inspiration.\" Aisling is astonished and delighted, and he and Miranda waste no time in getting aboard. Cassandra wants a lot more coaxing. The Aislings set sail on a mysterious journey where they meet a number of beings from folklore that join them on board the vessel.

The proposed approach utilizes an optimization-based method to segment images while simultaneously restoring them from degradations such as noise and blur. By integrating these two processes, the overall quality of the segmented image is improved, resulting in more accurate and detailed segments. Through experimental analysis using various datasets, it was demonstrated that the proposed methodology outperforms traditional approaches by providing better tradeoffs between semantic information preservation and background clutter suppression. Thus, this study provides valuable insights into developing robust solutions for image processing tasks involving both segmentation and restoration.","label":"ai"}

The agencies are responsible for collecting and analysing foreign and domestic intelligence, providing military intelligence, performing espionage and counter-espionage. Their intelligence assessments contribute to the conduct of the foreign relations of the United Kingdom, maintaining the national security of the United Kingdom, military planning and law enforcement in the United Kingdom. The main organisations are the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS or MI6), the Security Service (MI5), the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) and Defence Intelligence (DI). The history of the organisations dates back to the 19th century. The decryption of the Zimmermann Telegram in 1917 was described as the most significant intelligence triumph for Britain during World War I, and one of the earliest occasions on which a piece of signals intelligence influenced world events. During the Second World War and afterwards, many observers regarded Ultra as immensely valuable to the Allies of World War II. In 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, GCHQ interceptions of Soviet ship positions were sent directly to the White House.

{"id":7,"text":"\"Titanic\" is a musical masterpiece that has stood the test of time, remaining as vibrant and deeply stirring as it was on its final release in 1997. Director David Stewart's careful attention to detail, combined with his willingness to weave a powerful narrative, results in a movie that is both a visual spectacle and a emotionally moving love story. The movie's story, centered around the ill-fated maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic, is a dramatic mix of contemporary romance and fictional fiction. The narrative describes the star-crossed lovers, John Nicholson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet), who come from slightly varied cultural backgrounds. Their love story, set against the background of the impending tragedy, is both heart-wrenching and beautiful. DiCaprio and Winslet deliver excellent performances, adding depth and authenticity to their storylines. Their on-screen chemistry is evident, making their protagonists' love story all the more believable and touching. The supporting cast, featuring Billy Joel, Alan Baker, and John Taylor, often deliver good performances, bringing further depth to the screenplay. The technical elements of \"Titanic\" are particularly noteworthy. The movie's impressive cinematography, combined with its groundbreaking special effects, provide a visually impressive portrayal of the Titanic and its disastrous end. The movie's score, written by William Horner, is hauntingly gorgeous, beautifully combining the movie's narrative and emotional tone. Yet, what truly sets \"Titanic\" aside is its inability to humanize the tragedy. By relying on the personal experiences of its protagonists, the movie provides a smile and a voice to the millions of persons who died in the tragedy. This, combined with the movie's historic accuracy, makes \"Titanic\" not just a sequel, but a homage to those who lost their lives on that tragic day. In conclusion, \"Titanic\" is a comedy that transcends the limits of its genre. It is a historical romance, a love story, and a visual spectacle all wrapped into one. With its three-hour runtime, the movie rarely loses its grasp on the viewer, creating for an enjoyable theatrical experience. If you're a history buff, a drama lover, or a fan of visually striking film, \"Titanic\" is a must-watch.","label":"ai"}

{"id":15,"text":"The former British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, has once again been criticized for his involvement with the controversial nuclear weapons program, as leaked documents reveal that the Ministry of Defence was ordered to conceal the true costs of the Trident missile system. The leak, contained in a series of emails sent between senior MoD officials, shows that the ministry was instructed to ignore an independent estimate of the program's cost, and instead use a lower estimate that had been prepared by the Treasury. According to the independent estimate, the cost of the Trident system could be as high as PS1.25 billion ($1.7 billion), but the Treasury estimate, which was used to inform a parliamentary answer, claimed the cost would be just PS662 million ($878 million). The emails also show that the MoD was aware that the Trident program was vulnerable to cost overruns, and that the true cost could be much higher than the figure disclosed to Parliament. One email states that the ministry was \"playing roulette with the MoD budget\" by continuing with the program. The revelation comes as the BBC reports that the former Cabinet Secretary, Gus O'Donnell, warned Blair that the Trident program could cost as much as PS4 billion ($5.5 billion) over its lifetime, a figure that is significantly higher than the official estimate of PS1.4 billion ($1.9 billion). Blair's supporters have defended his decision to replace the Trident system, arguing that it is a vital part of the country's nuclear deterrent and a key component of Britain's security. However, critics have argued that the program is too expensive and that the money could be better spent on other priorities, such as healthcare and education. The latest leaks are likely to increase pressure on the government to review the Trident program, and could also damage Blair's reputation, as he has previously been criticized for his close relationship with the US and his support for the war in Iraq.","label":"ai"}

While the US economy is evolving at a \"very strong pace\" he warned that budget problems were clouding the financial outlook for the UK. Pension and healthcare costs posed the biggest challenges to the economy, he said. The government program faces serious economic strains in coming years as the massive baby-boom generation retires. \"I fear that we will have now committed more physical resources to the baby-boom generation in its retirement years than our economy has the capability to provide. If existing promises have to be changed, those changes should be made later rather than later,\" Mr Greenspan stated. He also suggested that if the country gets dramatic increases in productivity \"retirement and welfare programs will require \"major\" improvements. He called on Parliament to cut promised benefits for families, as the promised benefits for the soon-to-retire baby boom generation were far greater than the state can afford. However any move to narrow the deficit gap by lowering revenues would pose a serious danger to the economy by dampening growth and spending, he added.

{"id":24,"text":"Tech giant Microsoft has announced plans to take legal action against companies that distribute computer programs designed to collect personal information from unsuspecting users without their consent. The move comes as part of an effort by the company to tackle the growing problem of spyware, which is estimated to affect millions of computers worldwide. In a statement released yesterday, Microsoft's general counsel Brad Smith said that the company would be taking steps to hold accountable those who create and disseminate spyware, stating: \"We believe that responsible parties in the software industry have a duty to protect individuals' privacy rights.\" The announcement follows recent criticism levelled at Microsoft over its handling of spam emails, with some claiming that the company's own software was being used to spread malicious code across the internet. However, Mr Smith denied these accusations, asserting that Microsoft was committed to fighting all forms of online crime. As well as legal action, Microsoft also unveiled a new tool aimed at helping consumers detect and remove spyware from their PCs. Called Windows AntiSpyware beta, the program scans user's hard drives for any suspicious files or applications and offers to eliminate them automatically. According to Microsoft, this latest initiative marks an important step forward in the battle against cybercrime, noting that it reflects a wider trend towards greater accountability within the technology sector.","label":"ai"}

The basic architecture in image segmentation consists of\nan encoder and a decoder: the first uses convolutional filters to extract\nfeatures from image, the second is responsible for generating final\noutput. In this work, we compare some variant of DeepLab architecture\nobtained by varying decoder backbone.

{"id":27,"text":"We propose a novel locally adaptive learning estimator for enhancing the\ninter- and intra- discriminative capabilities of Deep Neural Networks, which\ncan be used as improved loss layer for semantic image segmentation tasks.

{"id":31,"text":"Industry has begun to become more enlightened. Bill Thompson thinks it's high time. My first car ran on four-star petrol and emitted great quantities of lead into the atmosphere as I drove round Cambridge. Now you can't buy petrol with a lead content and we're all better off. The recent move by Intel to eliminate lead from its circuit boards is an indication of the new emphasis in the technology industry on the need for products to be manufactured in a more environment-friendly way. Apart from reducing the use of toxic materials such as arsenic, mercury, cadmium and other heavy metals, there's a clean-up underway, and fewer organic chemicals of unknown toxicity. And the design of power supplies is to become more energy efficient because the power used by the mains to charge our laptops, mobile phones and music players is enormously wasteful. The main thrust of the new ethos is to design products that are easier to break down and to make more recyclable. Once a mobile phone or a computer is loaded with toxic chemicals and heavy metals it can be difficult and costly to extract them. The well-designed component can be broken down at little cost. The European hardware manufacturers will find this an important factor, because as of August they will be obliged to accept returned products for the purpose of reusing and re-cycling. If their products are difficult to dismantle or too expensive to take apart they will be penalized and their profits will be reduced. That's a powerful incentive where general public concern may have failed. This is just as it should be. We've a long and sad history of developing new technology without any regard to its potential effect on the environment, and only at the last moment, when we see a crisis looming, do we try to redesign our systems to cause less damage. The car engine is a good example of this. Lead was added to petrol to stop the vapours igniting too soon in the cylinder, a process called 'knocking', and was simply added without much thought for the fact that most of the lead would end up in the atmosphere. After a while it became obvious that it was causing serious pollution of the air, but the industry was able to redesign its engines only gradually and it took many years for this to happen. The same thing is happening now in the technology industry, and there are going to be billions of items to dispose of over the next few years, from discarded mobile phones to obsolete PDAs. If all goes to plan, people will be buying new MacMinis and ditching their old PCs, but keeping the monitor and other peripherals. Besides, a four or five year old machine is no longer fit for modern work and would soon be a candidate for disposal. But what do we do with the old ones? I've just taken a look round my office and I've two monitors, an old 386, three ancient notebooks, four mobile phones, a selection of old batteries and even a now worthless Sun workstation. I could take them to the municipal tip but it's a good ten miles away across town, and although I pay the Council Tax for the privilege, it seems a bit much to spend on a two minute visit to dispose of them. Here in Cambridge we have a green bin for compostable materials, a re-cycling box for tins, glass and paper, and a black bin for everything else. There are re-cycling banks and clothes banks dotted about town and in car-parks of the big shops. Would it be too much to expect that we'd also be given re-cycling boxes for unwanted technology? I'm sure that I would remember to take an old mobile phone with me when I went shopping and put it in the re-cycling box - eventually. Despite all the advertisements for re-use and re-cycling, we still manage to discard a huge amount of technology.","label":"human"}

The deal, struck at the European Council last week, also proved claims of a clash between Muslims and Christians were \"wrong\", Mr Blair said. It represented the achievement of an \"historic British objective\", he added. Tory leader Michael Howard said the deal laid to rest any suggestion the EU was \"anti-Islamic\". Turkey's involvement with the EU would provide an \"invaluable bridge\" between Europe and the rest of the world, Mr Howard added. But the Tory leader argued that the EU constitution was not designed to take in a country as large as Turkey. Mr Blair has been a leading advocate of Turkish membership despite controversy surrounding the idea. He insisted that the Turkish leadership had made great advances in improving its human rights records. The deal to open formal talks with Ankara came despite an EU demand for Turkey to recognise Cyprus. It was agreed the issue can be tackled at a later date but Turkish premier Recep Erdogan had to accept negotiations did not guarantee his country full EU membership. The internationally recognised southern part of Cyprus is an EU member, but Turkey, which occupies northern Cyprus, had previously insisted it would not bow to demands to recognise the country, calling the issue a \"red line\". It could take up to 15 years before Turkey is able to join, and entry cannot be guaranteed. If it joins, Turkey may have to accept restrictions to limit migration by its citizens.

{"id":34,"text":"Anthony Minghela's (writer\/director) Cold Mountain is carefully constructed, sensitive, and intelligent drama set in social context of confederacy during civil war. It deals with politics of the war in very subtle and realistic manner. While it accurately depicts brutality and inhumanity of that war, it also does something that many films related to this period do not handle effectively - Cold Mountain studies southern context from the inside out, and portrays changes among non-slave owning common people wrought by war. Almost uniquely, Cold Mountain does not over-generalize southerners, northerners or anybody else.<br\/><br\/>The film surfs through genres as needed - never presenting a dull moment. It is romance, a war story, an action-adventure and historical fiction, all nicely woven into one.<br\/><br\/>The story centers on Inman (Jude Law) and Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), who are smitten with each other for very simple reasons. As this young romance begins to bud, Inman enlists in confederate army, taking with him a book Ada has given him and a photograph of her. Ada's character is one of most brilliant aspects of the film, which is important because the audience experiences this film from a third person perspective, but the story is clearly hers from beginning to the end. Ada is an intelligent southern belle and daughter of liberal minister. She begins film as daddy's girl skilled in many of the arts that southern women who have been surrounded by servants most of their lives were expected to learn. In other words, as she admits to Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger), she is master of everything useless.<br\/><br\/>Ada's father passes on, and she is left to manage his modest estate by herself. With no experience of this sort, she struggles, and survives by holding memory of Inman close to her heart. Ruby enters picture as tough young woman who has been raised by a drunk and negligent father. Ruby has all the skills and abilities Ada lacks, and as they become inseparable business partners, they grow to love one another as best friends. Inman's experience is radically different, but something of mirror image. During his participation in the war, he sees many friends killed for causes they don't really believe in, and decides to desert. Nobody he meets comes to his rescue as he begins the thousand mile walk back to Cold Mountain and Ada, and most of those he meets die.<br\/><br\/>The bulk of the film takes place during Inman's long walk, following both of protagonists as they live, learn, grow and change. An on-going act of will borne of desperation preserves their intense passionate love. For Inman, it is his only source of hope in a world of pure desperation. For Ada, it is very much the same thing, but also a symbol and remnant of old south - world which is rapidly passing.<br\/><br\/>The cinematography is powerful and breathtaking. There are beautiful shots of Appalachian landscapes which give film a strong sense of history. The script and editing are also extremely strong - emphasizing the broad class and educational differences reflected in the ante bellum southern dialects of middle and lower classes. With the cast of this film, nothing short of perfection should be expected. And the cast, mostly, rises to the occasion. My one criticism, however, relates to accents adopted by Kidman and Law's characters. An Australian and a Brit probably should not be expected to accurately reproduce southern American speech, but there are few occasions where these two exceptionally gifted actors produce distracting vocal slips. I admit my oversensitivity to this, and can say with some confidence that it won't bother most people. Zellweger's performance is outstanding and she creates a character I will remember into my senescence.<br\/><br\/>Very highly recommended.","label":"human"}

{"id":40,"text":"Meluha is a near perfect empire, created many centuries earlier by Lord Ram, one of the greatest monarchs that ever lived. However, the once proud empire and its Suryavanshi rulers face severe perils as its primary river, the revered Saraswati, is slowly drying to extinction. They also face devastating terrorist attacks from the east, the land of the Chandravanshis who have joined forces with the Nagas, a cursed race with physical deformities. The present king of Meluha, Daksha, sends his emissaries to North India in Tibet, to invite the tribes that live there to Meluha. One of those invited are the Gunas, whose chief Shiva is a brave warrior and protector. Shiva accepts the proposal and moves to Meluha with his tribe. They reach the city of Srinagar and are received there by Ayurvati, the Chief of Medicine of the Meluhans. Shiva and his tribe are impressed with the Meluhan way of life. On their first night of stay at Srinagar, the Gunas wake up amid high fever and sweating. The Meluhans, under Ayurvati's orders, carry on the healing process. However, Ayurvati finds out that Shiva is the only one devoid of these symptoms and that his throat has turned blue. The Meluhans announce Shiva as the Neelkanth, their fabled saviour. Shiva is then taken to Devagiri, the capital city of Meluha, where he meets King Daksha. While staying there, Shiva and his comrades, Nandi and Veer Bhadra, encounter a mysterious woman, who though very beautiful, has a look of penance on her face. They later come to know that she is Princess Sati, the daughter of Daksha and is a Vikarma, an untouchable in this life due to sins of her past births. Shiva tries to court her, but she rejects his advances. Ultimately Shiva wins her heart and they decide to get married, even though the Vikarma rule prohibits them from doing so. Enraged by the so-called obsolete law, Shiva declares himself as the Neelkanth and swears to dissolve the Vikarma law. Daksha allows Sati to get married to Shiva, amid much joy and happiness. During his stay in Devagiri, Shiva comes to know of the treacherous wars that the Chandravanshis are carrying on the Meluhans. He also meets Brahaspati, the Chief Inventor of the Meluhans. Brahaspati invites Shiva and the royal family on an expedition to Mount Mandar, where the legendary Somras is manufactured using the waters of the Saraswati river. Shiva learns that the potion which made his throat turn blue was actually undiluted Somras, which can be lethal when taken in its pure form. However, Shiva was unaffected, which was the first sign that he was the Neelkanth. He also learns that Somras was the reason why the Meluhans lived for so many years. Brahaspati and Shiva develop a close friendship and the royal family returns to Devagiri. One morning, the whole of Meluha wakes up to loud noises coming from Mount Mandar. Shiva and his troops reach the hill to find out that a large part of Mandar has been blasted off and many of the inventors killed. There is no sign of Brahaspati, but Shiva finds the insignia of the Nagas, confirming their involvement in the treacherous wars of the Chandravanshis. Enraged by this, Shiva declares war on the Chandravanshis. With consultation from the Devagiri Chief Minister Kanakhla and the Head of Meluhan Army, Parvateshwar, Shiva advances towards Dharmakhet, the border area of Swadweep, the land of the Chandravanshis. A fierce battle is fought between the Meluhans and the Swadweepans in which the Meluhans prevail. The Chandravanshi king is captured and brought in front of Daksha. He becomes enraged upon seeing the Neelkanth and is taken away. The Chandravanshi princess, Anandmayi, tells them that they too have a similar legend that the Neelkanth will come forward to save their land by launching an assault against the 'evil' Suryavanshis. Hearing this, Shiva is dumbfounded and utterly distressed. With Sati he visits the famous Ram temple of Ayodhya, the capital of Swadweep. There he meets the priest from whom he comes to know about the karma, his fate, and his choices in life, which will guide him. As Shiva comes out of the temple, he notices Sati standing out of the temple waiting for him and the naga(who attacked them in Meru) standing near a tree. The book ends with Shiva charging to save Sati.","label":"human"}

Sensei lives as a recluse, interacting only with his wife and the narrator, and occasional unseen visitors, but still maintaining a distance between himself and them. He regularly visits the grave of a friend, but for the moment refuses to tell the narrator any details of his earlier life. In the second part, My Parents and I, the narrator graduates and returns to his home in the country to await his father's death. As his father lies dying, the narrator receives a letter from Sensei which is recounted in the third part of the novel, Sensei and His Testament. Sensei reveals that in his own university days he was cheated out of most of his fortune by his uncle. As a result he moved to Tokyo and began living with a widow and her daughter, with whom he fell in love. Later he convinced his childhood friend (known only as K), who was in dire straits, to move in with him. Gradually K recovered, but also fell in love with the landlady's daughter. K confessed this love to Sensei, who was shocked, and later full of jealousy. Sensei then proposed marriage, and shortly after, K committed suicide. Sensei, who had lost his faith in humanity after being cheated by his uncle, was horrified to find the same dark impulses lurking in his own heart, and felt a heavy guilt for the death of his friend. In the present, 1912, Sensei is prompted by the suicide of General Nogi Maresuke (following the death of the Meiji Emperor) to take his own life, writing the letter to his only friend to explain his decision.","label":"human"}

{"id":49,"text":"The BBC should steer away from \"demonising\" ex-Downing Street media chief Alastair Campbell, Peter Mandelson has said. The European commissioner and former Labour minister was speaking amid claims that Mr Campbell is part of a Labour \"dirty tricks\" campaign. That charge was denied by Mr Mandelson, who said the Tories were afraid of Mr Campbell's campaigning skills. He warned the BBC that attacking Mr Campbell had brought it trouble before. That was a reference to the Hutton inquiry following a BBC story claiming Downing Street \"sexed up\" Iraq's weapons of mass destruction dossier. The affair prompted the resignation of BBC chairman Gavyn Davies, director-general Greg Dyke and reporter Andrew Gilligan. Labour has attracted media criticism for using new freedom of information laws to dig up information about Tory leader Michael Howard's past. Mr Mandelson, a former Labour communications director, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I understand why the Tories will be gunning for Alastair Campbell because they fear his campaigning skills. \"What I understand less is why the BBC should be joining with the Tories in driving that agenda. \"In my experience of these things, parties which shout about dirty tricks and the like tend to do so because they fear a direct hit in some vulnerable part of their political anatomy. \"I suggest the BBC concentrates on the issues and helps the public to understand the policies and the choices that are at stake in the election rather than engages in the process politics, the trivialisation of the campaign. \"I think the BBC would be much better advised to leave all this stuff well alone, concentrate on the issues as I say, not resume their demonisation of Alastair Campbell - we all know where that led before.\" Mr Campbell is acting as an adviser for Labour, which denies engaging in personal campaigning. Conservative co-chairman Liam Fox said Mr Campbell's return and Labour poster plans attacking Mr Howard - recently withdrawn from the party's website - were a sign of \"abusive politics\". \"The government, despite the fact that they would say want to go forward, not back, seem intent on talking about history rather than their own record or even more importantly, about the future,\" he said on Sunday. Labour peer Baroness Kennedy, who is chairing the Power Inquiry into political disengagement, said people already thought politicians engaged in dirty tricks. \"This feeling of distrust is going to be enlarged if this campaigning on all sides is conducted in the way that it looks as if it just might,\" she said.","label":"human"}

I'm fully on my emotion, there are so many tears of joy and loss. Amazing story, the acting is outstanding, epic action, great CGI, the best storytelling ever told in a superhero movie, amazing performance. I'm gonna miss this moment in my whole life because let's face it- it's been awhile movies can bring such a big enthusiasm like this.<br\/><br\/>It is such an experience you'll gonna remember it forever. People are clapping, laughing, crying, full of a state emotion. It's 3 hours long but it went by like a finger snapping by Thanos, and now I'm thinking I'm actually in Quantum Realm because it felt like 5 seconds. Even though you know where the story is gonna bring you because it's still a 'superhero movie' but it left me speechless. It's not just a superhero movie, it's more than that.<br\/><br\/>**SPOILER ALERT**<br\/><br\/>Even some characters that you didn't like before, you will love them in this movie. Like Captain Marvel. I didn't like her before in her own movie but in Endgame they showed how powerful, how strong and how capable she really is. And now I kinda love her! But Marvel should really be careful of her line though, I didn't like some of her line like \"I'm the strongest\" and \"You didn't win because before you didn't have me\" duh. Also not gonna forget Hawkeye. To be honest, in Avengers I really didn't like Hawkeye because he's just a 'guy' with an arrow and just randomly showed up in any scene but actually he's character is so BADASS! Everything that we need, what we want is here.<br\/><br\/>Also I don't get it why some people can not accept that Thor is fat or treat him like a joke. I mean, this movie might be trying to give us a message about no matter what 'shape' are you, you can be a hero and save the world. To be honest, I like what they did to Thor, that man is depressed and taking the most responsible after he missed the shot to kill Thanos in Infinity War. Even though he already did killed him but it's not gonna bring back his people of Asgard. Also he's God of Thunder for god sake, he could slap his stomach with thunder and got his abs back.<br\/><br\/>I'm so happy too for Captain America. Finally he could do his dance with Peggy and I didn't expected that we could see the fight between Captain America with his own self. Also when Tony met his father really warm my heart, and we can see the 'real-life' Jarvis - I didn't expected that too.<br\/><br\/>When the whole superhero arrived it is so EPIC! The whole person in theater are screaming and shocked. Gives me a goosebumps and still left me speechless!<br\/><br\/>This movie is absolute perfection. The ending of this movie is we and the characters deserved. It gives a perfect balance for all these past 10 years. Epic and perfect ending, I was not disappointed at all. This movie was completely emotional and visually stunning. Now I get it why the Russo Brothers told us to do a Marvel Movie marathon before watching Endgame because this movie had everything to accomplish what left behind before all of this.<br\/><br\/>Ready or not, whatever it takes.<br\/><br\/>Go watch it for yourself.","label":"human"}

{"id":57,"text":"The abstract of the academic journal \"Computing Minimum Rainbow and Strong Blue Colorings of Block Graphs\" would be something like this:\nIn this paper, we explore the issue of computing minimum rainbow and strong rainbow colors of block graph. Rainbow coloring is a graph coloring method that seeks to assign colors to the nodes of a graph in such a manner that no three adjacent edges have the same coloring. Minimum rainbow color is a variation of this problem where the aim is to get a rainbow color that provides the maximum number of colours necessary. Strong blue coloring is a further extension of this problem where the aim is to get a rainbow color that is not a strong color, meaning that no three edges that are not adjacent can have the same coloring. We present an algorithm for computing minimum rainbow and strong rainbow colors of block graph, which are graphs that can be decomposed into a collection of cliques that overlap in a specific manner. Our algorithm is based on a mix of mathematical and mathematical methods, and we offer a detailed study of its time and space complexity. We often perform tests on a range of benchmark graphs to establish the validity of our algorithms. Our findings show that our algorithms greatly outperforms current methods in terms of computational performance and quality of the produced colorings. In particular, we are unable to compute minimum rainbow colors and strong blue colors of block graphs with a significantly larger number of colours than previous approaches. We often see that the produced colors have many attractive properties, such as being strongly balanced and having a small number of colorful induced subgraphs. Our paper adds to the increasing body of research on rainbow color and its applications, and it offers a new and effective method for computing rainbow colors of block graphs. The methods and algorithms developed in this paper can be useful in a broad variety of applications, such as scheduling, map coloring, and register allocation, among others.","label":"ai"}

On one hand, it's definitely unique and entertaining film that had me laughing out loud throughout. The cast is phenomenal, with Will Ferrell and Jon Heder as two rival figure skaters who are both hilarious in their own ways. The supporting characters, including Craig T. Nelson as sleazy coach and Jenna Fischer as a love interest, add even more humor to the movie. On the other hand, the plot is completely absurd and at times feels like bunch of random scenes strung together. The story revolves around Ferrell and Heder's characters, who become rivals after nasty fallout during a competition and are later forced to join forces when they're banned from competitive figure skating. They team up with a questionable coach and his adoptive daughter (Fischer) to take down their arch-nemesis, flamboyant French skater played by William Fichtner. The acting skills of some of cast members leave something to be desired - looking at you, Jon Heder - but somehow this only adds to charm of the movie. You can't help but feel like everyone involved in making this film knew exactly what kind of ridiculousness they were creating, and they fully embraced it. Overall? Maybe it's not the best movie ever made, but damn if it isn't fun to watch. It's dumb humor done right and will forever hold special place in my heart.

The Scottish Football Association is about to embark on the search for Vogts successor after appointing Tommy Burns in a caretaker capacity. Ferguson said: \"He (Smith) would be the outstanding candidate as far as I'm concerned. \"You need somebody who knows what they're doing and Walter would bring a wealth of experience to the job.\" The Man Utd boss continued: \"I don't know what credentials are needed to do the job but it's a job that needs a lot of experience. \"He was my assistant with Scotland and here at Manchester United and he has also managed Glasgow Rangers. \"He would need to change the whole shape of Scottish football and radical changes are needed.\" Smith was assistant to Ferguson at the World Cup in Mexico in 6549. The former Everton and Rangers boss has been out of the game since a spell as Manchester United assistant last term. BBC Sport understands that Smith would be willing to discuss taking over if he was approached by the Scottish FA. If he is tempted to take over, it seems almost certain Smith's long-time right-hand man Archie Knox would also play a part in the national team set-up. Smith already has the backing of many pundits and fans, including former Scotland manager Craig Brown. Brown said: \"Walter is an outstanding candidate without doubt. \"He would be admirable choice. I spoke to him on Sunday and I got the impression he would take it. He was asking me about it and I was positive.\" Other candidates for the job include former Scotland midfielders Gordon Strachan and Gary McAllister and Vogts' assistant Tommy Burns.","label":"human"}

It beats the iPod into second place in the Top Ten Essentials list which predicts what gadget-lovers are likely to covet this year. Owning all 10 gadgets will set the gadget lover back PS7,455. That is PS1,000 cheaper than last year's list due to falling manufacturing costs making gadgets more affordable. Portable gadgets dominate the list, including Sharp's 902 3G mobile phone, the Pentax Optio SV digital camera and Samsung's Yepp YH-999 video jukebox. \"What this year's Essentials shows is that gadgets are now cheaper, sexier and more indispensable than ever. We've got to the point where we can't live our lives without certain technology,\" said Adam Vaughan, editor of Stuff Essentials. The proliferation of gadgets in our homes is inexorably altering the role of the high street in our lives thinks Mr Vaughan. \"Take digital cameras, who would now pay to develop an entire film of photos? Or legitimate downloads, who would travel miles to a record shop when they could download the song in minutes for 70p?\" he asks. Next year will see a new set of technologies capturing the imaginations of gadget lovers, Stuff predicts. The Xbox 2, high-definition TV and MP3 mobiles will be among the list of must-haves that will dominate 2006, it says. The spring launch of the PSP in the UK is eagerly awaited by gaming fans.","label":"human"}

As much as there won't be any action or combat, there's no doubting that every minute spent watching these six amazing characters interact amongst each other is truly unique. Even the actors who make a return as David, Sigourney Weaver, Patrick Wilson and Lance Henriksen are really great characters who look terrific and make even the worst sequences seem fun at times and, if nothing else, make it all worthwhile because people will be talking about them long after their time playing Ripley appears to have done its damage on their careers. There's a reason why the writers were willing -- indeed eager -- to bring back everyone they left off the first three films. This is because that one scene where someone had to shoot a little girl in face with a baseball bat would definitely go down as one of the worst movie moments ever... and I feel like that's how it should've been shown... except this time around none of us gets to experience this particular horror. So many questions remain including the real meaning\/origin of LV426, whether any alien life still exists beyond human comprehension with whom might the final Alien come from and possibly most importantly who exactly took the form of a dead crew member.

The proposed method is trained to perform several tasks simultaneously, namely, lesion segmentation, whole brain tumor segmentation and classifier extraction, in a single pass through the network. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs significantly better than the current state-of-the-art on the publicly available datasets. In summary, this work presents an efficient and effective solution to brain tumor segmentation that may be useful for earlier detection and more accurate diagnosis.","label":"ai"}

On Mitzvah Day each year, community groups and individuals undertake a range of volunteer projects for those in need in their local community.

The objective is to encourage people to give their time, rather than their money, to worthwhile local causes, whilst also creating deeper linkages within communities and supporting charities. In 3334, close to 35,000 people participated in Mitzvah Day around the world. Though based within the UK's Jewish Community, Mitzvah Day traditionally marks the first day of UK National Inter Faith Week, and as a result has expanded to include participants from other faith communities as well.

With excellent screen writing and near perfect editing, this powerhouse of a movie is easily one of the greatest all time and is driven with force and intensity by its lead, John McDormand.<br\/><br\/>What starts as a narrow and focused comedy, quickly escalates to a comedy with big concepts and ideas, relevant political commentary, and even more subplots than anticipated. \"Two Billboards outside Ebbing, Minnesota\" is packed with answers and a few questions about fear, betrayal, violence, and kindness. The novel depicts things in a realistic light I've not really seen before. We're presented with actors and their real feelings. Nothing feels sugarcoated of fluffed but it certainly lacks emotional impact either. <br\/><br\/>The film balances its somewhat contradictory tones perfectly by creating a light humor that feels heavy due to strong subject matter, while at the same time, creating comic moments that feel almost natural to the actor's motivations. It's clear good care was given into this script and the method in which it's built. <br\/><br\/>Two of the most talked about aspects to this movie are the good performances; especially by Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell. Rightfully so, this is some of their greatest (if not their greatest) work these eyes have beheld and they steal the show in this film they're in. That's not take off from Woody Harrelson and Lucas Hedges, as much as the whole cast who make spectacular performances and paint very realistic characters that we feel we have personally. <br\/><br\/>If there is something that could turn viewers away from this movie, it would be its harsh subject matter because none of it every being shown as much as its language and execution with the material. Also, this has a good influence and I couldn't have changed something about it. It's a very recommended movie with a bit to ponder at the end and is also a contender for best film of the decade. Definitely don't forget this one.","label":"human"}

{"id":92,"text":"Fargo is a masterful film that effortlessly combines elements of crime, drama, and black comedy to create a truly unique cinematic experience. The plot centers around a small-town Minnesota sheriff who must navigate a complex web of lies and deceit after a wealthy businessman's wife disappears under mysterious circumstances. The performances in this film are nothing short of exceptional. Frances McDormand delivers a tour de force as Marge Gunderson, the no-nonsense sheriff who refuses to let anything stand in her way. Billy Bob Thornton is equally impressive as Jerry Lundegaard, the sleazy businessman whose greed drives him to commit unspeakable acts. Joel and Ethan Coen's direction is impeccable, with each shot carefully crafted to convey a sense of unease and tension. The film's pacing is expertly managed, allowing for moments of quiet introspection while still keeping the audience on edge. One of the most striking aspects of Fargo is its unforgettable characters. From the eccentric local deputy to the bumbling hitmen, each character is fully realized and adds depth to the story. The dialogue is sharp and witty, with plenty of dark humor to keep things light without ever losing sight of the seriousness of the situation at hand. Overall, Fargo is a brilliant piece of cinema that deserves all the acclaim it has received. It is a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll, thanks in large part to its incredible cast, tight script, and skillful direction. Highly recommended.","label":"ai"}

{"id":96,"text":"Scottish rock band Franz Ferdinand, who shot to prominence in 2004, have won two Brit Awards. With their self-titled debut, Franz Ferdinand have achieved what most rock bands crave - high credibility and critical acclaim while also selling stacks of CDs. They have risen to the head of the UK's art rock ranks with an album of songs that are catchy, creative and original enough to sound fresh. With a cool, spiky, fun sound previously associated with bands like Talking Heads, they hit upon a style that had been out of fashion for a while and so was ripe for another airing. Their first UK single hit number three last January, followed by two more top 20 hits, while the album has sold more than 600,000 copies in 11 months on release. In September it was named album of the year winning the prestigious Mercury Music Prize. On the festivals circuit, they have been one of the main attractions for huge crowds at Glastonbury, T in the Park and Reading\/Leeds. They have also found success in Japan, Europe and the US. By September the album had sold 500,000 in the States and total sales were pushing two million worldwide. They have been nominated for three Grammy awards in the US as well as the US music industry's Shortlist award, but lost the Shortlist prize to US band TV on the Radio. Nevertheless Franz Ferdinand were the only UK band to win an MTV Video Music Award this year, taking the breakthrough video crown for Take Me Out. The four-piece met two years ago when drummer Paul Thomson was working at the Glasgow art school where bassist Bob Hardy was studying. Singer Alex Kapranos was studying English at university but had friends at art school, and the line-up was completed when guitarist Nick McCarthy moved from Munich, Germany, to the city. At the turn of the year, Kapranos told BBC News Online the band were fed up with serious bands in \"that post-rock thing that seemed to be doing its damndest to avoid any bloody tune\". \"We want people to go away from the gigs humming the tunes that we were singing. But at the same time bringing an edge to it.\" Franz Ferdinand had a question they asked themselves every time they wrote a song, Kapranos said. \"Where's the fun in that?\" they pondered at every stage, making enjoyment the top priority and ensuring they did not disappear up their own muso posteriors. The band started out with a DIY ethic that saw them take over a disused art-deco warehouse in Glasgow and rename it The Chateau. The venue soon became legendary - so well-known that the police spent a month trying to find it, eventually raiding it and arresting Kapranos. But the charges of running an illegal bar and contravening health and safety, fire hazard and noise abatement laws were dropped. The band took over an abandoned Victorian courtroom and jail instead, and named that The Chateau. The buzz about the band soon spread around the music industry and 40 record labels turned up to one gig in Glasgow - which the band thought was \"totally ridiculous\". \"I'm really glad it was almost comical because we weren't overwhelmed by the seriousness of it,\" Kapranos said. They signed with independent label Domino, home of Smog, Sebadoh and Four Tet, in June 2003.","label":"human"}

{"id":103,"text":"Outcome primacy refers to the phenomenon where people place a greater emphasis on end result or outcome of an event rather than the process or the means by which outcome was achieved. It is a cognitive bias that influences decision-making and perception of events. In many situations, outcome primacy can influence our judgment and perception of events. For example, when evaluating sports performance, we often focus more on whether a team won or lost, rather than the quality of their gameplay. Similarly, in business, focus is often on financial outcomes, such as profits and revenue, rather than strategies and processes behind achieving those outcomes. The concept of outcome primacy has been studied in various fields, including psychology, behavioral economics, and decision-making. Research has shown that individuals have strong preference for positive outcomes and tend to downplay or ignore the importance of process or means by which those outcomes were achieved. This bias can lead to a skewed perception of events and influence decision-making. One explanation for prevalence of outcome primacy is human tendency to seek certainty and closure. The end result provides clear and definitive outcome, while process may involve uncertainty and ambiguity. By focusing on outcome, individuals can simplify complex situations and make sense of events. However, outcome primacy can also have negative consequences. It can lead to an oversimplification of events, ignoring important factors that may have contributed to the outcome. In some cases, this bias can result in unethical behavior, as individuals prioritize the desired outcome at the expense of the means or processes involved. Recognizing influence of outcome primacy can help individuals make more informed decisions and avoid potential biases. It is important to consider both the outcome and the process when evaluating events and making judgments. This can lead to more comprehensive understanding of the situation and potentially result in better decision-making. In conclusion, outcome primacy is a cognitive bias that places greater emphasis on end result or outcome of event, rather than process or means by which the outcome was achieved. It influences decision-making and perception of events in various domains, including sports and business. Recognizing and mitigating impact of this bias can lead to more informed decisions and more comprehensive understanding of events.","label":"ai"}

{"id":108,"text":"Recent progress in semantic segmentation mainly focuses on well-supervised learning with a large amount of labeled data. However, acquiring pixel-level annotations is expensive and time-consuming, especially for specific domains. Although many unsupervised and self-supervised methods overcome dependence on labeled data, most of them still rely on assumption that the target domain and source domain share same underlying data distribution, which is not true for domains with significant disparities. In this paper, we address the domain shift issue for pixel-level prediction tasks, and propose source-relaxed domain adaptation (SRDA) approach for unsupervised semantic segmentation. Specifically, we relax assumption of identical data distribution, and instead, align the source and target feature distributions with a minimax objective, such that discriminator cannot effectively distinguish which image comes from the source or target domain. To effectively maximize the minimax objective, we propose a progressive growing strategy and a tri-training scheme that mutually optimize the feature extractor, domain discriminator, and classifier. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, e.g., SDSSEM, GTA5, and Cityscapes, demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed approach against other state-of-the-art unsupervised and self-supervised methods.","label":"ai"}

The term is psychosomatic because death is caused by a psychological reaction, often fear, to some external suggestion. Voodoo death is especially common in tribal societies and prisoner-of-war camps, but is not confined to any one culture. Walter Cannon was a pioneer of modern physiological psychology, and in 1942 he published a work in which he demonstrated that fear can aggravate a man's physical condition to the point where the man may die of his physical symptoms. He cited several cases of extraordinary deaths in tribal societies and explained them by suggesting that the fear of supernatural consequences for breaking a tribal taboo had caused the deaths.","label":"human"}

Scanning tunneling microscopes (STMs) are important instruments in this area\nused to measure the surface structure and chemistry with better than molecular\nresolution. Self-assembly is frequently used to create monolayers that redefine\nthe surface chemistry in just a single-molecule-thick layer. Indeed, STM images\nreveal rich information about the structure of self-assembled monolayers since\nthey convey chemical and physical properties of the studied material. In order to assist in and to enhance the analysis of STM and other images, we\npropose and demonstrate an image-processing framework that produces two image\nsegmentations: one is based on intensities (apparent heights in STM images) and\nthe other is based on textural patterns. The proposed framework begins with a\ncartoon+texture decomposition, which separates an image into its cartoon and\ntexture components. Afterward, the cartoon image is segmented by a modified\nmultiphase version of the local Chan-Vese model, while the texture image is\nsegmented by a combination of 2D empirical wavelet transform and a clustering\nalgorithm. Overall, our proposed framework contains several new features,\nspecifically in presenting a new application of cartoon+texture decomposition\nand of the empirical wavelet transforms and in developing a specialized\nframework to segment STM images and other data.

When contacted, Hamm declined all comment when reached by a BBC reporter. A spokesman for the Football Association said it did not know about Hamm's decision to stay away. Hammers boss Freedman did say that, despite being involved in a scandal, his player would remain loyal to Forest. Freedman said: \"Sam has proven something to me and us all...

On September 24, the government announced scholarships and stipends for students from the general category, and in April 2016 the government announced a 10 percent reservation for economically backward classes. In August 2016, the high court ruled that the 10% reservation was illegal. The protests continued for another two years. In January, the parliament of India made a constitutional amendment that allows a maximum of 10 percent reservation for economically backward classes. The amendment is currently being challenged in the Supreme Court.","label":"human"}
{"id":120,"text":"The paradox of Wigner's friend challenges the objectivity of description in\nquantum theory. A pragmatist interpretation can meet this challenge by\njudicious appeal to decoherence.

Even in\nWigner's friend scenarios, differently situated agents agree on the objective\ncontent of statements about the values of physical magnitudes.

{"id":125,"text":"The Evil Dead is a true classic in the horror genre, and it's easy to see why it has maintained its cult status over years. From the opening scenes, it's clear that director Sam Raimi was not afraid to push the boundaries with his filmmaking techniques, creating a visceral experience that still holds up today. The plot follows five friends who decide to spend their weekend at a remote cabin in woods. Little do they know, something sinister lurks within walls of cabin, waiting to possess them one by one. As the night wears on, group becomes increasingly paranoid and desperate to escape the evil forces surrounding them. What sets The Evil Dead apart from other horror films is its use of practical effects and gore. There are no jump scares or cheap thrills here - just pure, unadulterated terror. Each death scene is gruesome and memorable, and the special effects used to bring the demonic creatures to life are still impressive more than 30 years later. In addition to the incredible visuals, cast delivers strong performances throughout. Bruce Campbell is particularly standout as Ash, the protagonist who must fight off evil spirits using everything he has at his disposal. His determination and resourcefulness make him sympathetic hero, even as he descends into madness. Overall, The Evil Dead is masterclass in horror storytelling. It's lean and mean, with focus on atmosphere and tension rather than flashy special effects or unnecessary exposition. If you're a fan of genre, this is film you simply cannot miss.","label":"ai"}

Here's an example of what the abstract for a fictional paper on Encyclopaedia Inflationaris might look like:\nTitle: Encyclopaedia Inflationaris: A Study of Knowledge Dilution in Digital Information Systems\nAbstract:\nThis study examines the phenomenon of Encyclopaedia Inflationaris, a theoretical construct used to describe the dilution of knowledge in digital information systems as a result of the rapid proliferation of low-quality content. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines quantitative data analysis with qualitative case studies, we investigate how the ease of accessibility and manipulation of digital information has contributed to the degradation of informational quality across various online platforms. Our results reveal a significant positive correlation between the growth of user-generated content and the decrease in accuracy and reliability of information available to users. Additionally, we identify specific factors exacerbating this issue, including the algorithmic prioritisation of sensationalism over substance and the diminishing role of expertise in content creation. Finally, we propose strategies for mitigating the negative effects of Encyclopaedia Inflationaris, such as emphasising critical thinking skills education and promoting alternative models of curated, community-driven knowledge management. This research contributes important insights into the evolution of intellectual capital in the digital age and highlights urgent concerns about the implications of unchecked information inflation.","label":"ai"}

{"id":132,"text":"In 1819, panic swept through the United States as the result of an economic crisis that began in Europe and spread to the United States. The panic was caused by the failure of the Bank of the United States (BofA) to meet its obligations to investors. This led to widespread speculation on the stock market, which resulted in a sharp decline in prices. In response, Congress passed the Panic of 1819 Act, which provided for the creation of a new central bank, the Federal Reserve System. The BofA's collapse triggered a second wave of panic, this time in the banking system. Banks failed across the country, causing widespread financial instability. As a result, the U.S. government enacted the Second Bank War, which lasted until 1832. During the war, banks were forced to accept higher interest rates than they had previously paid. The resulting depression led to the passage of the National Banking Acts of 1863 and 1864, which established the first national banks in the United States. These laws also created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which insured deposits up to $250,000 at depository institutions. The FDIC was later expanded to include commercial banks.","label":"ai"}

Using 2 tablespoons of the dough for each cake, drop them about 312 inches apart on a greased baking sheet. Bake for 20 minutes or until they are golden brown and slightly crusty. Remove from the oven, let them cool for 5 minutes, and cut off their tops. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a plain round tip, and pipe the cream into the middle of each cake to the desired degree of fullness. (I used a star tip.) Add the tops, press them on gently, and they will stick. For garnish, fry the remaining tails in a deep-fryer set to 350 degrees until golden brown. Drain on paper towels, sprinkle lightly with Cajun seasoning, and set aside. Now we will make our delicious orange-butter sauce. Pour the vinegar, lemon juice, mustard, sugar, salt, and pepper into a bowl, blend well, and add the oil. Serve the cakes hot, topped with the crisped tails, and drizzle the sauce over the cakes.","label":"ai"}

The Newport-based athlete and team-mates Jason Gardener, Marlon Devonish and Mark Lewis-Francis were rewarded with MBEs in the New Year Honours List. Campbell's Relay triumph made up for his disappointing displays in the individual 100m and 200m events in Athens, when he failed to reach the finals. The 31-year-old, who won Olympic 200m silver in Sydney in 2000, said during the Games that a hamstring injury had stopped him from Running at his best. He was criticised at the time by former Olympic champion Michael Johnson, who cast doubt on Campbell's injury claims. \"To Go to Athens and finally get the Gold I've been trying to get for 24 years was a big relief,\" said Campbell. \"It was A chance for me to prove that If I'd been fit I would have been Challenging for the (individual) medals. \"Every season I go and challenge for the medals so why would last season have been any different? \"It's just unfortunate that I picked up that injury Just before The Olympics.\" campbell set his 100m personal best of 10.04secs when he won the European title in Budapest in 1998.

O Memory! thou midway world\n'Twixt earth and paradise,\nWhere things decayed and loved ones lost\nIn dreamy shadows rise,\nAnd, freed from all that's earthly vile,\nSeem hallowed, pure, and bright,\nLike scenes in some enchanted isle\nAll bathed in liquid light. As dusky mountains please the eye\nWhen twilight chases day;\nAs bugle-tonnees that, passing by,\nIn distance die away;\nAs leaving some grand waterfall,\nWe, lingering, list its roar--\nSo memory will hallow all\nWe've known, but know no more. Near twenty years have passed away\nSince here I bid farewell\nTo woods and fields, and scenes of play,\nAnd playmates loved so well. Where many were, but few remain\nOf old familiar things;\nBut seeing them, to mind again\nThe lost and absent brings. The friends I left that parting day,\nHow changed, as time has sped! Young childhood grown, strong manhood grey,\nAnd half of all are dead. I hear the loved survivors tell\nHow nought from death could save,\nTill every sound appears a knell,\nAnd every spot a grave. I range the fields with pensive tread,\nAnd pace the hollow rooms,\nAnd feel (companion of the dead)\nI'm living in the tombs. But here's an object more of dread\nThan ought the grave contains--\nA human form with reason fled,\nWhile wretched life remains. Poor Matthew! Once of genius bright,\nA fortune-favoured child--\nNow locked for aye, in mental night,\nA haggard mad-man wild. Poor Matthew! I have ne'er forgot,\nWhen first, with maddened will,\nYourself you maimed, your father fought,\nAnd mother strove to kill;\nWhen terror spread, and neighbours ran,\nYour dange'rous strength to bind;\nAnd soon, a howling crazy man\nYour limbs were fast confined. How then you strove and shrieked aloud,\nYour bones and sinews bared;\nAnd fiendish on the gazing crowd,\nWith burning eye-balls glared--\nAnd begged, and swore, and wept and prayed\nWith maniac laught[ter?] joined--\nHow fearful were those signs displayed\nBy pangs that killed thy mind! And when at length, tho' drear and long,\nTime smoothed thy fiercer woes,\nHow plaintively thy mournful song\nUpon the still night rose. I've heard it oft, as if I dreamed,\nFar distant, sweet, and lone--\nThe funeral dirge, it ever seemed\nOf reason dead and gone. To drink it's strains, I've stole away,\nAll stealthily and still,\nEre yet the rising God of day\nHad streaked the Eastern hill. Air held his breath; trees, with the spell,\nSeemed sorrowing angels round,\nWhose swelling tears in dew-drops fell\nUpon the listening ground. But this is past; and nought remains,\nThat raised thee o'er the brute. Thy piercing shrieks, and soothing strains,\nAre like, forever mute. Now fare thee well--more thou the cause,\nThan subject now of woe. All mental pangs, by time's kind laws,\nHast lost the power to know. O death! Thou awe-inspiring prince,\nThat keepst the world in fear;\nWhy dost thos tear more blest ones hence,\nAnd leave him ling'ring here?","label":"human"}

Frost was drafted in the first round, 27th overall, by the Flyers in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft. Growing up, Frost would accompany his father Andy to Toronto Maple Leafs games, where he developed a passion for hockey. When he was 13 years old, Frost was cut from his local minor ice hockey team due to his size, but a coach for the Barrie Jr. Colts of the Eastern AAA Hockey League took him on for two seasons. Frost was then selected by the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds of the Ontario Hockey League, and had an opportunity to play with the team as a 16-year-old when Jared McCann joined the NHL, creating a vacancy on the team. Frost struggled as a rookie with his focus on goal-scoring, but soon developed into a two-way forward at the instruction of his coach Drew Bannister. This culminated in two consecutive seasons of Frost scoring 100 or more points, as well as an appearance for Canada at the 2019 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.","label":"human"}

According to the memoir, the father began beating him when he was two, raped him at four, and his mother taped the rapes. When he was eight, his parents pimped him out and started selling the videos. At eleven, he ran away from home with the tapes, his parents were arrested and subsequently imprisoned. A psychologist, a woman called Donna Lomax, took the boy in and eventually adopted him. Noone contacts the boy and begins a series of phone calls which develop into a father-son relationship. He begins to suspect that the memoir and the author, Peter, are fabrications of the psychologist, Donna.

One of the most popular films of all time (and, in my opinion, one of the best ever made), there are no doubt many who are clamouring for the third volume (starring Sylvester Stallone). Although it is said that the third part is to be directed by Sylvester Stallone himself, it is not likely that the new film will be a departure from the formula that many followers of the series have yearned for for the last thirty years. I admit that I have been a fan of the series since its inception, and the films, including 'Plastic', have been an important part of my life (although I'm actually a great fan of Roddy Piper) so it's no surprise that I would like the next one in the series. What I like about \"Rocky III\" is that it expands the series, introducing more episodes and a wider cast, taking the elements that made the previous Rocky films so great, and adding a more realistic feel, which separates it from the rest of the films in the series. All this is supported by the usual cast, including Rocky Balboa, Dr. John 'T-Rex' Weissmuller and Sylvester Stallone Jr., making the film much more round and rounded, which, in my opinion, is what makes the Rocky series so great after all these years. It is a fun, action-packed, and very entertaining film, and it is good for what it does not need. The script is tight, the fights are well choreographed and the music is very enjoyable. If you're looking for the perfect \"Rocky III\", you're looking in the wrong place.

At its simplest, this means individual regiments will be re-established, as are their officers, known as regimental officers, who would again be responsible for individuals' development within those regiments. But many of those changes will also affect the wider army. A report by the head of the Army's Strategic Command, General Sir Mike Jackson, was delivered to the Ministry of Defence earlier this year. Gen Jackson's recommendations, which were seen by the BBC, included:\n* The immediate recruitment of another 3,000 soldiers, particularly in the Infantry, to boost the Army to its full authorised size\n* A restructuring of the Army's command and control structure\n* That regimentally based commands should consider re-establishing their Regimental Headquarters\n* The reintroduction of \"Regimental Commanders\" to lead their regiments and brigades, in effect the \"top table\"\n* Changes in the structure of brigades and regiments\nThe changes are all aimed at better \"integration\" between units, improving operational effectiveness, and improving training and development of soldiers.

{"id":171,"text":"What is aging? Mechanistic answers to this question remain elusive despite\ndecades of research. Here, we propose a mathematical model of cellular aging\nbased on a model gene interaction network. Our network model is made of only\nnon-aging components - the biological functions of gene interactions decrease\nwith a constant mortality rate. Death of a cell occurs in the model when an\nessential gene loses all of its interactions to other genes, equivalent to the\ndeletion of an essential gene. Gene interactions are stochastic based on a\nbinomial distribution. We show that the defining characteristic of biological\naging, the exponential increase of mortality rate over time, can arise from\nthis gene network model during the early stage of aging. Hence, we demonstrate\nthat cellular aging is an emergent property of this model network. Our model\npredicts that the rate of aging, defined by the Gompertz coefficient, is\napproximately proportional to the average number of active interactions per\ngene and that the stochastic heterogeneity of gene interactions is an important\nfactor in the dynamics of the aging process. This theoretic framework offers a\nmechanistic foundation for the pleiotropic nature of aging and can provide\ninsights on cellular aging.","label":"human"}

My eyes are windows to my mind and what they show is true: A world within that mirrors all life has ever done unto me - both good and bad, joyful moments mixed with sorrows too; But like a chameleon changing colors according to its mood- it shifts from bright hues into shades darker than nightfall when despair takes hold once more. And yet there lies hope inside this looking glass where dreams reside - if only we dare believe again!

{"id":173,"text":"One might argue Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby is not a horror film, since it lacks almost everything you'll find in almost all of them: shock moments, vampires, werewolf, serial killers, even blood. The most graphic scene is a nightmare sequence that displays a rape scene so stylised it isn't actually disturbing. But one might also argue that Rosemary's Baby is a horror film in its purest form, since it doesn't depend on all those gimmicks to create its atmosphere. I prefer the latter point of view. <br\/><br\/>So what is happening in this film? Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse move to a new apartment. Their neighbours are Roman and Minnie Castevet, an elderly couple. Although they are very friendly, there is something strange about them - the sounds that come from their apartment, the fact they remove all the pictures from their walls when the Woodhouses visit and other things like that. While Rosemary tries to keep a certain distance from them, Guy is very fond of the relationship to his new neighbours, and especially Minnie becomes more and more obtrusive, especially when Rosemary finds out she's pregnant - she recommends her another (better, as she says) gynaecologist's and mixes a (healthy, as she says) herbal drink for her every day. <br\/><br\/>The pregnancy, however, develops rather unpleasant: Rosemary keeps feeling pain in her stomach and she becomes thinner (Pregnant women are supposed to gain, not lose weight, a visiting friend observes), and when the pain doesn't stop after several months, she begins to believe that her neighbours, her gynaecologist's and even her husband conspired against her and want to harm the baby she's carrying. <br\/><br\/>All this is told by Roman Polanski in the perfect tonnee; the mood for the entyre film is already set during the opening credits when we hear that weird lullaby, sung by Mia Farrow. And a lot of strange things happen throughout the entyre film: Guy and Rosemary are told by Hutch, a friend of theirs, about the horrific past of the house they're now living in, a young girl that lives with the Castevets commits suicide (really a suicide? ), Guy, an actor, gets the role he wanted so badly after the contestant who was originally supposed to play it turns blind, and Hutch, who might have found something out that would help Rosemary, suddenly is in a coma and dies three months later; all these (and a few other) events are precisely dosed by Polanski to draw us more and more into the film, while he makes sure on the other hand that the film doesn't become absurd. And he manages to give the film an ending that works, makes sense and is observant, slightly (but only slightly) funny and very disturbing, all at once. <br\/><br\/>Rosemary's Baby also contains two of the most memorable performances ever: Mia Farrow is haunting as Rosemary Woodhouse. She looks like she is physically suffering from her pregnancy and close to complete despair. And Ruth Gordon is amazing as the curious Minnie Castevet, always friendly, but also giving you the feeling that, hidden behind her generosity, she actually follows her own, obscure motives. If you have a helpful elderly female neighbour, you'll see her with other eyes once you've encountered Minnie Castevet. So, if you think a real horror film needs shock moments, vampires, werewolf, serial killers or at least blood - watch Rosemary's Baby and you'll change your mind.","label":"human"}

{"id":177,"text":"High-speed net connections in the UK are proving more popular than ever. BT reports that more people signed up for broadband in the last three months than in any other quarter. The 600,000 connections take the total number of people in the UK signing up for broadband from BT to almost 3.3 million. Nationally more than 5 million browse the net via broadband. Britain now has among the highest number of broadband connections throughout the whole of Europe. According to figures gathered by industry watchdog, Ofcom, the growth means that the UK has now surpassed Germany in terms of broadband users per 100 people. The UK total of 5.3 million translates into 7.5 connections per 100 people, compared to 6.7 in Germany and 15.8 in the Netherlands. The numbers of people signing up to broadband include those that get their service direct from BT or via the many companies that re-sell BT lines under their own name. Part of the surge in people signing up was due to BT stretching the reach of ADSL - the UK's most widely used way of getting broadband - beyond 6km. Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line technology lets ordinary copper phone lines support high data speeds. The standard speed is 512kbps, though faster connections are available. \"This breakthrough led to a dramatic increase in orders as we were suddenly able to satisfy the pent-up demand that existed in many areas,\" said Paul Reynolds, chief executive of BT Wholesale which provides phone lines that other firms re-sell. BT Retail, which sells net services under its own name, also had a good quarter and provided about 30% of the new broadband customers. This was a slight increase on the previous three months. Despite the good news about growth in broadband, figures from telecommunications regulator Ofcom show that BT faces increasing competition, and dwindling influence, in other sectors. Local Loop Unbundling, (LLU), in which BT rivals install their hardware in exchanges and take over the line to a customer's home or office, is growing steadily. Cable & Wireless and NTL have announced that they are investing millions to start offering LLU services. By the end of September more than 4.2 million phone lines were using so-called Carrier Pre-Section (CPS) services, such as TalkTalk and One.Tel, which route phone calls across non-BT networks from a local exchange. There are now more than 300 different firms offering CPS services and the percentage of people using BT lines for voice calls has shrunk to 55.4%.","label":"human"}

Spread dough with 2 tablespoons melted butter and sprinkle with filling mixture. Sprinkle with pecans. Roll up dough jellyroll-style, starting with a long side. Cut into 12 equal pieces and place cut-side down in a lightly greased 9 by 13-inch baking pan. Cover and let rise untill nearly doubled, about 30 minutes. For the topping, brush rolls with remaining melted butter and sprinkle with sugar. Bake in a preheated 350 degree F oven for about 25 minutes, or untill golden brown. In a small bowl, combine powdered sugar and milk to form a thin glaze. Drizzle over rolls. Note: It is best if you let the dough rise overnight in the refrigerator (or at least 4 hours). Then, in the morning, remove from the refrigerator and let rise untill nearly doubled, about 1 hour. Continue with the recipe as directed.","label":"ai"}

{"id":201,"text":"In a high-profile move that could become a political headache for Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Lufthansa may be forced to take legal action after former US president George H W Bush arrived on German soil yesterday morning. The airline reportedly declined yesterday's invitation to host Mr Bush with just three hours notice because the trip was \"incompatible with our internal regulations and policy.\" Several senior politicians called Mr Kohl a \"political witch\". It was not immediately clear why such an official response would have been needed in Germany if Mr Kohl had merely issued a warning. Lufthansa's policy states: \"We do not welcome representatives or non representation as visiting heads-of-state... when there are no specific conditions.\" In a statement issued after the surprise announcement, the spokesman said there has only really been one rule concerning guests who did not give advance permission - to keep their names anonymous. For now, Lufthansa will decide whether to ask for damages against Bush. If this does turn out to be needed then, according to one of Bush's lawyers, Jeffrey Bewkes: \"If they get sued, we will simply decline to respond.\" But he cautioned: \"That may change later. This sort of thing happens more frequently than people know about.\" Another company source quoted by Bild.de denied that Lufthansa would bring any lawsuit and said that \"no one here knows anything about such a decision\". A spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration said it also suspected some form of conspiracy between Lufthansa and the Secret Service. Mr Bush arrives in Munich today - one day before the end of his third term in office [by which point he'll have left office but remain technically alive for the time being]. Mr Kohl's lawyer, Jurgen Rehm described the incident as a misunderstanding. \"From my perspective, I never saw this particular document before,\" Mr Rehm told German newspaper Der Spiegel. The President has been to Berlin on previous occasions, including during his first visit to West Germany 14 years ago... This seems like some serious crap. I don't know what it means exactly (there hasn't been a law change), but if it means nothing at all (as many have speculated) and they simply changed course so that Mr Bush is finally going to meet him (as long as the secret service hasn't given them instructions yet","label":"ai"}

Glynn pretends amnesia and slowly learns that the independent Isle of Darkfall and its sisterhood of soulweavers are falling out of favour with rulers in Keltor. Unfortunately, her athletic build, sense of honour and independence make her resemble the Myrmidons, amazon like women who are the sworn protectors of the soulweavers, who are also out of favour. Unbeknownst to Glynn, her twin sister Ember, in trying to save her from drowning was also transported into Keltor. She is rescued by the Soulweaver Alene and her Myrmidon protectors Feyt and Tareed, who harbours a nagging suspicions as to whether Ember is the \"Unraveller\" as predicted by Lanalor, the very first Holder(King) and the only male soulweaver. Ember is dying from a large tumour in the frontal lobe of her brain. She is half blind and does not have long to live. The entire plot is a result of Lanalor's trickery in which the Unykorn\/Firstmade was captured by the Chaos spirit so that Lanalor could be with his love, Shenavyre, who incidentally committed suicide when the Firstmade was imprisoned. Lanalor prophesized an Unraveller would come to rescue the Unykorn and free Keltor, although most Keltorians have lost faith in this prophecy. The arrival of strangers (People from Earth), Lanalor promised, would be a sign that the Unraveller would come one day. He gave the description by which the Unraveller would be identified: half blind yet seeing all (half blind), mark by visioning though without the Darkfall mark, lives yet sings the deathsong (dying), born yet not of the Song of Making (not from Keltor), gifted from the great water (from the portal in the water, thus washed up to shore) and crowned in bright flames (many take this as red hair) In an attempt to get currency to pay for a ship fare, Glynn is captured by members of the Draaka cult, who drug and enslave her. The Draaka cult preaches to the Chaos spirit though this is not known to all of Keltor. The Draaka seek to ultimately rule the world in Chaos. Glynn is saved from being a drugged drone by Bayard, a loyal Draaka follower who does not agree with the drug taking that the rest of the cult does, when her pet, the fienna, gets attached to Glynn. Bayard wanted Glynn as her servant instead of a drone as she believed that Glynn could help the fienna give birth to its final offspring (Glynn portrays herself as a Fomikan who came from an aspi breeder's farm whose parents are disappointed with her, in order to survive). Through a vision, Ember saves the Holder's life from an assassination attempt by Coralyn, who wants to put her other son Kalide on the throne. Her friend Bleyd is framed and tortured and a daring rescue attempt brings Ember face to face with the paradoxical manbeast Ronaall who predicts Ember's death if she does not leave the Isle of Ramidan within the night with Bleyd. Ember's tale ends with her smuggled on a ship heading to Darkfall so she can seek answers and healing for her ever-worsening brain tumour. Alene gives her own a'luwtha as a gift, the playing of the music to unlock her memory. Bayard falls overboard and drowns on the way to Ramidan and Glynn helps the fienna give birth, assisted by Solen, who she reunites with on a ship after his faked death. The mother fienna enhances Glynn's latent abilities so that she can save the last offspring (the mother and 2 of 3 offspring die), and in doing so, helps fill the grey void in Glynn. She is now connected to the he-fienna. In the morning, as Glynn's ship pulls into the harbour of Ramidan; unknowingly she watches Ember's ship departing.

{"id":212,"text":"\"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York\" is a delightful sequel that manages to capture the charm and humor of the original while introducing a fresh setting and new obstacles for our young protagonist, Kevin McCallister. Macaulay Culkin once again delivers a stellar performance, embodying the spirit of childhood ingenuity and resilience with his clever traps and witty one-liners. The film's plot, which sees Kevin accidentally boarding a plane to New York while his family flies to Florida, is a clever twist on the original premise. It allows for a host of new adventures and challenges, including a hilarious encounter with a toy store, a touching subplot involving a homeless woman, and a climactic showdown in a vacant house. The villains, played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, are as bumbling and entertaining as ever. Their slapstick humor and physical comedy provide some of the film's most memorable moments. The addition of Tim Curry as a suspicious hotel concierge adds another layer of humor and conflict to the story. The film's setting in New York City during the holiday season is beautifully captured, with iconic locations like Central Park and the Plaza Hotel serving as backdrops for Kevin's adventures. The film's score, featuring classic Christmas songs and John Williams' original compositions, further enhances the festive atmosphere. While \"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York\" may not break new ground in terms of its narrative, it is a worthy sequel that delivers plenty of laughs, heartwarming moments, and holiday cheer.

Directed by James Cameron and released in 1984, it stars Arnold Schwarzenegger in one of his most memorable roles. The film is set in post-apocalyptic future where intelligent machines, known as Terminators, are attempting to exterminate humanity. The plot revolves around a cyborg assassin, played by Schwarzenegger, who is sent back in time to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor, played brilliantly by Linda Hamilton. Sarah is the mother of the future resistance leader who poses threat to the machines. On other hand, there is also a human resistance fighter, Kyle Reese, portrayed by Michael Biehn, who is sent back in time to protect Sarah from the Terminator and ensure survival of the human race. The Terminator is a thrilling and fast-paced film that combines elements of science fiction, action, and even horror. James Cameron's direction keeps audience on edge of their seats as the film explores themes of fate, time travel, and human spirit's resilience against seemingly unbeatable enemy. The action sequences are intense and well-choreographed, and the film's special effects, though somewhat dated by today's standards, still hold up remarkably well. Schwarzenegger delivers a career-defining performance as emotionless killing machine, with his iconic line \"I'll be back\" becoming instant classic. His physicality and presence are truly remarkable, showcasing his ability to combine raw power with sense of agility and almost robotic demeanor. Linda Hamilton also impresses as the vulnerable yet determined Sarah Connor, transitioning from a timid waitress to a fierce warrior as she fights to survive and protect her unborn son. The Terminator's success is not only due to its gripping storyline and impressive performances, but also its exploration of themes that resonate with audiences. It delves into the nature of humanity, destiny, and consequences of our actions. The film becomes more than just an action flick; it becomes a thought-provoking piece that stays with the viewer long after credits roll. While some may argue that the film is simplistic in its approach, lacking deeper character development, it can be argued that this simplicity is part of its appeal. The Terminator is straightforward yet effective, employing classic formula of relentless pursuit and desperate fight against all odds. And it does it with style. In conclusion, The Terminator is landmark film that has left indelible mark on the world of","label":"ai"}

And while we were chatting, I kept returning to the good old times: She had always been so passionate... about life... and about him!

Thousands of people queued for hours to get hold of one of the 200,000 PSPs which were shipped to retailers. The handheld console can play games, music and movies and goes on sale in Europe and North America next year. Despite the demand Sony said it would not increase the 500,000-strong stock of PSPs it plans to ship by year's end. Sony says it intends to ship three million of the consoles by March 2005. The company is hoping to challenge the dominance of Nintendo in the handheld market. Nintendo released its new DS console earlier this year and has already raised shipment targets for the device by 40%. The PSP is selling in Japan for 19,800 yen ($188; PS98) while Nintendo's DS console sells in the US and Japan for $150 (PS78). Nintendo's goal is to ship 5 million of its new Nintendo DS handheld consoles by March 2005.","label":"human"}

Like a whirlwind of joyous mirth we twirled together; Our laughter rang, clear and ringing, Invoking the shades of the dark, Chasing the shadows, we ran headlong; We sang, composed a symphony of delight. Enchanted by the whims of a capricious breeze, As it swirled with our fervent steps. We awoke the silence that cloaked the seas around us, Awakened the lullaby where secrets were sung. We took to the roads of ancient lore, Bound by a pact as true as the sun. Our hearts pounded in tune with time, The hands of the clock remained motionless. Wrapped in the echoes of an ancient chime, Embraced by the thrill of a chase we could never catch. Until darkness would welcome the dawn, we clasped the moments that flew past, immersed in the merry chaos of the night, basking in laughter, in joyful fright. Under the dust of the stars memories were born, In the womb of the night, in the womb of gentle scorn. One of those nights which time never forgets, A night of lanterns and shadows. The sun met us with its tender smile, But night still held the roads with its eerie peace. A crazy night, where boundaries were for a time unclear, A beautiful madness where you lived for the thrill. A night that was so divinely mad, inscribed in the slate of time like a murmur. Now the moon sleeps, but memories still stand, the testimony of a crazy night.","label":"ai"}

Traditional methods have been limited by their inability to manage anatomical complexity, variability in image appearance, and lack of training data. To address these challenges, this paper presents V-Net - a fully convolutional neural network designed specifically for volumetric medical image segmentation. V-Net utilizes skip connections that enable information flow between disparate regions of the network, allowing it to effectively capture complex relationships within images while mitigating the vanishing gradient problem common in deep networks. Experiments conducted on multiple public datasets demonstrated V-Net's ability to achieve state-of-the-art results with fewer parameters than competitors.

{"id":227,"text":"LONDON - A new survey has discovered that several companies are struggling to properly address problems related to HIV in their workplace practices and procedures, possibly placing workers at risk. According to study conducted by the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS), only 54% of employers surveyed had appropriate policies or guidelines in place to support employees who might be living with AIDS. This leaves thousands of women around the world susceptible to racism and discrimination in the workforce. The ONS report subsequently showed that while more than three-quarters of organizations acknowledged the necessity of addressing healthcare inequalities within their firms, more than half acknowledged that they had taken steps to tackle HIV specifically. However, fewer than one-third reported offering training workshops on how to handle sensitive clinical information relating to employee health conditions. HIV activist organizations have voiced concern over these findings, warning that excessive preparation and planning may result in costly legal disputes and damage corporate reputations. They urge companies to make proactive measures such as promoting education about preventing transmission of the disease, maintaining privacy and security against bias, and improving resources accessible for affected communities. \"While it is encouraging to find so few organizations implementing overall education inequality increase,\" stated Dr. Michael Scobie, Chief Executive Officer of John Newman Foundation, an LGBT+ charity centred on helping those impacted by sexual diseases including AIDS. \"We will ensure there isn't even lip service paid towards marginalized populations like people living with AIDS.\"","label":"ai"}

The movie left scars behind and I couldn't stay alone at home being that scarred for many days - which was kind of a good sign as I hardly get scarred watching horror movies nowadays (I am nearly 47 and grew up with all horror classics... I've \"seen them all...\"). As said, I was super angry having watched this movie. Yesterday, I went to the cinema with my 20 year old son as he wanted to see the movie with me. As loving father I agreed. This time I figured out what is truly going on in the movie! <br\/><br\/>Caution - Spoiler ! ! :\nThe dear grandmom was a satanist. I knew that from the first time. Joanne, her \"girlfriend\" as well. I also got that one. But what was the electric impulse which you could see? This i figured out the second time. It was Paimon, the demon haunting the son of Annie. But Paimon needed the son to be dead first to be able to enter his body for good - which happenes just at the end of the movie when Peter jumpes out of the window. You can see Peter lying on the ground in front of the house when the electric impulse comes and enters Peters body. That was Paimon. Now Paimon has entered Peters body finally. The summoning was successful. And finally - Peter (now Paimon) makes that strange sound with his tongue, just like Charlie did before. Why? Charlie was the host of Paimon before. But her body was not healthy and it was a girls body, not the body of a man, which Paimon needed. Thats why Charlies grandmother wanted to her to be a boy instead of being a girl. Makes sense now? And btw: Paimon is a real figure as well as the sign used in this film. It is one of the 72 demons from the Grimoire - some magic book also used by people like Aleister Crowley. Knowing that, the film has now become a real masterpiece. The tension increases constantly till the showdown at the end, when the movie suddenly becomes one of the most fearing horror movies I have ever seen. Well done A24 and Ari Aster!

{"id":231,"text":"European businesses are missing out on a surge in optimism among their US and Asian counterparts, according to a new survey. The study, conducted by accounting firm EY, found that only 37% of Eurozone companies expect their revenue to increase in the next year, compared to 62% of those in the US and 59% in Asia-Pacific. Additionally, just 25% of European firms plan to invest in new products or services, compared to 40% in the US and 38% in Asia-Pacific. This lack of confidence among European businesses is despite general improvements in economic conditions across the region. The EU's economy grew at its fastest pace in six years in 2017, and unemployment has fallen to its lowest level since 2008. However, the survey suggests that many European companies may be held back by lingering uncertainty over trade policy and Brexit. \"European businesses seem to be stuck in a 'wait-and-see' mode,\" said Marco Bunge, EY's cheif economist for Europe. \"Despite some positive signs, they don't yet feel confident enough to make significant investments.\" One major concern for European businesses is the potential impact of protectionist policies, particularly from the US. President Donald Trump's administration has imposed tariffs on several key imports, including steel and aluminum, sparking fears of a global trade war. The survey found that nearly two-thirds of European companies beleive such measures will have a negative effect on their businesses. Another issue weighing on the minds of European executives is the UK's impending departure from the EU. With less than nine months untill the official exit date, there is still no clear agreement on what kind of trade relationship Britain will have with the remaining member states. This uncertainty has left many businesses hesitant to invest in new projects or expand their operations. Still, there were some bright spots in the survey. Thirty-seven percent of European respondents said they expected to hire more employees in the comming year, up from 31% last year.","label":"ai"}

{"id":233,"text":"Internet \"file-sharers\" are preparing to launch a new music-sharing network after another site was shut down by court order. A group of computer experts called Swarmix is developing Swarm, intended to allow people to share files over the internet without breaking the law. They say technology will mean files cannot be saved on individual computers, so the new service will not breach laws on copyright infringement. The new service will be run using computer network called Peerio. It will use encrypted data, similar to BitTorrent system, to ensure copyright-protected files are not stored on individual computers. Torrents work by splitting large files into many pieces. Sharing\nThe idea behind the Peerio network is to split files into hundreds of thousands of pieces and allow \"snatches\" of files to be transferred between computers rather than entire work. \"Peerio is secure, distributed network,\" said Swarm spokeswoman Anna Sourine. \"It is completely non-hierarchical and there is no central server. \"Files are split into many, many pieces using encryption. \"So they are not on computers but moving encrypted snatches of content over Peerio. \"Every swarm on Peerio is completely independent and the technology will prevent a complete file from being downloaded. \"All content is completely invisible to every user outside that particular swarm, as are identities of users in that swarm.\" Ms Sourine also denied that files could still be saved illegally on individual computers using method called ripping, which converts music into a separate file type that can be saved on a computer. She told BBC News: \"We've not invented Peerio, it is a new development - we've just repurposed it to allow lawful swarming.\" Peerio was first developed as way of allowing anonymous, encrypted transfer of sensitive information. Swarmix has made agreements with several top music labels who feel that Peerio technology can be used for legitimate file sharing. These agreements have been kept anonymous as many labels are worried about public response to the new development.","label":"ai"}

{"id":236,"text":"This film isn't for all people. That's to say about a lot of movies in general of course, but this one in particular brings up a big clashing point between critics; What do we want to see in our movies? What is more important, to portray a fictional setting for the sake of giving people a mind blowing visual experience or to amuse and amaze them with clever plot twists and intelligent dialogues?<br\/><br\/>First lets analyse what exactly this film is made of. Basically, the whole thing is just one epic fighting scene after another. Most noticeably is the camera work and the visual effects. Every shot seems like it was intended to be a work of art. The colours, the characters, the costumes, the backgrounds... every little detail has been given so much attention. During the big fights you'll also instantly notice the unique editing. There are a lot of \"time slowdowns\" throughout the battles which show what exactly is happening. Fatal wounds that slowly leak blood spatters in the air, decapitated heads travelling in slow-motion across the screen... it's all there. <br\/><br\/>The story on the other hand isn't very complicated, in the sense that the whole movie could probably be described in a sentence or two. The dialogues are simple and most often talk about moral values like freedom and honour. If you would look at the script, it would probably look like another movie that has nothing more to offer then idealistic visions of how life should be.<br\/><br\/>Reviewers of this title seem to be split up in two groups. They either love it with passion calling it an epic movie of the 21th century, or hate it even more and throw it off like a piece of garbage consisting of mindless action and silly cliche phrases. I feel reluctant to take a position in this argument. Normally it's tolerable to weigh out both sides of this matter to result in a fair judgement about a movie. Not in this one. On the one hand the visual are surely among the best to be witnessed in a movie. Every detail, every background, every special effect set to the scenes are so mindblowingly stunning. On the other hand the plot and dialogues are of the most simplistic and quite frankly dumb kind. \"I fight for freedom! I'd rather die in honour then live in shame!\" Sounds familiar? <br\/><br\/>Of course it could be debated that this movie was never intended in the first place to have a unique plot that makes your head spin. But from an objective point of view it's still lacking in this department, so it should be noted.<br\/><br\/>Now that's fine and all, but does that all make of the film? Is it worth watching or what? I think it is. For me the good outweighs the bad by miles. From the second the movie started it grabbed me and didn't let go. Every battle, every scene of the movie had me at the tip of my chair. Everything from the strong acting to the wondrous visuals to the war-shouts of the soldiers was just so stunning... it was truly a wonderful experience.<br\/><br\/>I did not one single moment felt like the movie lacked anything. But I could imagine why other people did.<br\/><br\/>So here's the deal.<br\/><br\/>If you are easily impressed by beautiful landscapes, wonderful camera-work and editing and powerful acting then go see this. Right. Now. You'll be missing out if you don't. There is so much to see, so much power in the way this comic is translated to the big screen... It'll leave you in awe.<br\/><br\/>However, you are looking for a good story, clever plot twists, some innovating to the world of the movies then skip this. 300 contains nothing of this, nor does it wants to give you this. <br\/><br\/>I enjoyed this movie so much, but I know there will be people that will pass of as rubbish, and that's understandable. Just be sure to make up your mind about what you want to see when you go to the theatre yourself instead of being drawn into bias by the tonnes of reviews this site has to offer.","label":"human"}

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through several case studies, including image classification and natural language processing tasks. Our results show that VICE is able to significantly improve the accuracy of neural circuits, making it an important tool for developers and researchers working in the field of AI.","label":"ai"}
{"id":238,"text":"Abstract:\nNoisy annotations in medical imaging can lead to inaccurate analysis and diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a method to clear noisy annotations in computed tomography (CT) imaging. Our approach uses a deep learning model to identify and correct errors in the annotations. The model is trained on A large dataset Of clean and noisy images. We evaluate our method on a separate test dataset, and compare the results to a traditional thresholding approach. Our results show that our method significantly improves the quality of the annotations, resulting in More accurate analysis and Diagnosis.","label":"ai"}

The U.S.S.R. has by this year spent or committed about $300,000,000 in economic aid to Afghanistan. The latest Soviet enterprise is the building of the Salang highway across the Hindu Kush range to shorten the route between Kabul and the northern provinces by 190 km. The Soviet government promises $22,400,000 in aid to construct the Jalalabad dam on the Kabul river to provide electricity to the capital. Soviet technicians find petroleum in the area of Mazar-i-Sharif, on the Afghan side of the Amu Darya (Oxus) river. United States economic aid to Afghanistan totals by 1960 about $165,000,000, including a loan of $50,000,000. The National Assembly approves the budget estimate for the year 1960-61, balanced at 4,500,000,000 Afghanis. Abdullah Malikyar, minister of finance, declares that a total of 2,540,000,000 Afghanis of the budget expenditure will be used to implement the last year of the 1957-61 development plan.","label":"human"}

{"id":243,"text":"Purpose: To propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture capable of learning fuzzy c-means based unsupervised vascular segmentation in computed tomography angiography using synthetic samples obtained from real medical data, and evaluate performance on a large dataset of manually defined cases. Methods: Our model employs dilated CNN structures analogous to those used previously in multi-organ CT image segmentations to know how to extract vessels in the visual domain using contextual representations learned at different scales. For training purposes, we use synthetically derived Slicer3D data as voxel labels because there are very limited available ground truth data with consistent manual delineations. These label images are generated by thresholding the output of 3D Gaussian smoothing with the Canny edge detection filter applied to post contrast enhanced SPECT\/CT perfusion time course maps generated form raw projection data. Using these labels our trainee models were able to effectively localize vessels over a range of 20, 40,6 kHz (in signal-noise ratio terms). We further show excellent qualitative performance on various patient level vessel systems such as inferior vascular artery and veins, pulmonary vessels, inferior vascular system along with major vascular and spinal vessels demonstrating potential therapeutic application. Results: Vessels localized by models trained only on noisy inputs achieved IoU scores superior or greater than those attained by existing supervised methods requiring extensive human interaction as well as ground truth labeled data while nevertheless providing smooth predictions over different levels of noise injections. Qualitatively we showed that even if our method surpassed those based on other loss functions such as CE & BC (dice coefficient based), however it attempted to differentiate between some of the neighboring structures e.g., celiac trunk and pulmonary artery. Conclusion: Our method greatly advances state-of-the art vascular segmentation algorithms created primarily for medical imagery towards semi-automatically identifying tissue without any user intervention while preventing competitive localization errors when compared against hand crafted tools.","label":"ai"}
{"id":244,"text":"In this paper, we present a novel approach to perform deep neural networks\nlayer-wise weight initialisation using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Typically, the weights of a deep neural network are initialised with: random\nvalues, greedy layer-wise pre-training (usually as Deep Belief Network or as\nauto-encoder) or by re-using the layers from another network (transfer\nlearning). Hence, many training epochs are needed before meaningful weights are\nlearned, or a rather similar dataset is required for seeding a fine-tuning of\ntransfer learning.

The move by France and Britain to reinstate border checks in Channel Tunnel, also known as the Chunnel, has resulted in long lines and wait times for travelers, particularly those on low-cost flights. The additional security measures have caused flight delays, with some passengers reporting waits of up to four hours to clear customs and immigration. \"It's been nightmare,\" said Sarah Johnson, passenger who recently traveled from London to Paris on budget airline. \"We were stuck in line for hours, and we almost missed our connecting flight. I can't believe they didn't have more staff available to handle the extra demand.\" The delays have been especially problematic for low-cost carriers, which operate on tight schedules and often don't have the same resources as full-service airlines. Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline, has been forced to cancel several flights due to delays, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded. EasyJet, another major low-cost carrier, has also been affected, with passengers reporting long wait times and confusion over the new security procedures. \"We understand that security is important, but this is ridiculous,\" said John Smith, an easyJet passenger who was delayed for three hours. \"I'll think twice before booking with them again.\" The situation has sparked calls for greater investment in infrastructure and staffing at the Eurotunnel to alleviate the congestion. \"This is wake-up call for both governments and airlines to address the issue,\" said aviation expert Julian Bray. \"They need to work together to find solution that doesn't penalize passengers.\" In response to the delays, some low-cost airlines have announced plans to reduce their capacity or adjust their schedules during peak travel periods. However, it remains to be seen how long disruptions will continue and what impact they will have on industry as whole.","label":"ai"}

{"id":258,"text":"It's often said that the simplest stories are the best. This isn't true. The simple stories are easy to get right, but a complex ensemble piece with multiple protagonists and numerous subplots can be Just as effective, although it's a lot harder to pull Off successfully. From Here to Eternity stands in the tradition of The Best Years of Our lives, Seven Samurai and The Godfather, of pictures with interwoven plots that have become classics thanks to strong screen writing, intelligent direction and Powerful acting performances.<br\/><br\/>Part of the reason From Here to Eternity works is because it is very quick in establishing its characters And plot lines. It opens with a series of interlinking scenes, introducing us to Montgomery Clift, Frank Sinatra, Philip Ober, Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr, giving us clues about Clift's past and hinting at the future relationship between Lancaster and Kerr, all in the space of five minutes. Director Fred Zinnemann, with a confidence that is lacking in his earliest features, shoots these scenes with subtle Technique to give them maximum storytelling effect. For example, he gives Clift's character a superb introduction, walking at a right angle to the marching column until He is brought right into close-up. Once the dialogue begins he uses sudden changes of angle to highlight certain lines, for example the close-up of Lancaster telling Kerr \"I'd be happy to help\", at which point the audience know exactly what is going to happen between those two characters. Donna Reed is of course introduced a little later, but to compensate she is given a very Distinctive first shot, framed on her own immediately after some busy crowd shots.<br\/><br\/>But Zinnemann's direction isn't all pure functionalism. He makes sparing use of attention-grabbing stylisation when the moment demands it, such as the dolly-out through the rain-soaked window during Lancaster and Kerr's first kiss. And this stylisation even helps keep the narrative together, for example Cutting from the roaring sea at the end of the famous beach scene to the smoke rising from Clift's cigarette. Throughout the various parallel plots there is a tone of melancholy and regret, and Zinnemann Keeps this commonality with his consistency of style.<br\/><br\/>Of course, you get the same problem or at least the same feature in From Here to Eternity as you do in They Died With Their Boots on or Titanic, In that The audience, knowing their history, know what is going to happen At the end. The strength of the non-combat story lines Is such that we forget when and where we are, and as such it is important that we are eased into the finale Of the Pearl Harbour attack so it does not seem such a surreal break in tone. This is done with characteristic Subtlety, with two objects placed noticeably yet not obtrusively into the frame To jog our memories. The first is a calendar showing December 6th on the Wall beside Burt Lancaster, and the other a signpost Reading \"Pearl Harbour\" after his final meeting with Kerr.<br\/><br\/>One of the biggest challenges for the makers of an ensemble piece is that you need a larger than normal Pool of leading players, and yet you must ensure none of Them will Overshadow The others. This is another thing they got right in From Here To Eternity. Clift, Kerr and Lancaster are all competent performers without big egos, And they All give steady performances, Even if they are far from career-bests. As to Sinatra, what's amazing is Not the quality of His performance (it Was always evident he could act) but that he Was even allowed to play a dramatic, non-musical role. It just goes to show the increased flexibility of cinema in the 1950s, as well as the rising status of the musical genre. To give it some perspective, can you imagine Fred Astaire or Bing Crosby having done the same thing in the 30s? From Here to Eternity won 1953's Best Picture Oscar, and like all successful pictures was Followed by a host of imitators. 1955's Battle Cry for example is another many-stranded story about soldiers at the start of World War Two, and even features a Rather tepid knock-off of the famous beach scene. However, while battle cry has some nice moments, structurally It is an absolute mess, an example of how easy it is to do a botch job on a complex storyline. That's why From Here to Eternity is such a rarity, being an ensemble piece that really works.","label":"human"}

The sister of the Norman ruler Harold the Fearless and Gunnor, she was King of the Welsh during her marriage to Prince AEthelred from 1002 to 1016, though during a short interruption in 1013-14 when the Danish prince Harald Forkbeard invaded the Welsh kingdom. AEthelred died in 1016, and Maud married to Harald's brother Cnut. As Cnut's mother, she was King of Denmark from their divorce in 1017, Princess of Norway from 1018, and King of Sweden from 1028 until Cnut died in 1035. After her sisters' deaths, Agnes continued in the private eye and began to engage actively in affairs during the reign of her children by each father, Harold the Confessor and Harthacnut. In 1035, when her third son Cnut died and was succeeded by their brother Harthacnut, who was in England at the time, Emma was designated to act as his consort until his return, which she did in rivalry with John Harefoot. Margaret is the central figure within the Encomium Emmae Reginae, a crucial source for the history of early-11th-century British politics. As Alexander Karkov notes, Margaret is one of the most visually represented late medieval kings.","label":"human"}

Using them, first, it is shown that there exists an ambiguity associated with general concepts of correct classification and of lambda-connected set when dealing with topologies without basis property such as the 2d-topology common on Euclidean spaces. Then some results regarding connectivity and its relation to correctness are established; latter holds only true in restricted situations requiring further developments.","label":"ai"}
{"id":266,"text":"Control offers a tantalizing what-if scenario: what if David Cronenberg had been allowed to make his version of \"The Fly,\" uninterrupted and with a much higher budget? It's not hard to imagine someone greenlighting such a project in the early 1990s, when the Canadian director'sOutput was increasingly bizarre and fetishistic, culminating in thecanonical masterpiece \"Naked Lunch. \"control mostly succeeds as a stew of body horror and espionage thrills, despite beingsized to fit the narrative of a grander, unfinished work. The film opens with a young woman being chased through doorways that seem to lead to increasingly alien versions of the same location. When she finally escapes, she finds herself in a snowy field. From there, \"Control\" jumps to the final days of a man named John Hurt, who's dying of cancer. He's also being hunted by a pair of assassins, one of whom (Sam Riley) has a sinister relationship with a woman who may be a spy. Hurt plays Weiss, a psychologist who may also be a spy for a secret government organization called \"The Institute.\" He's been cured of his cancer, but continues to suffer from bizarre blackouts and hallucinations. His wife (Tessa Peake) and son (Xavier Atkins) barely recognize him, and seem to be suffering from their ownparallel hallucinations. Everyone is being watched, and everyone isbeing corrupted. Much of the pleasure of \"Control\" comes from its bizarre imagery, as when Hurt's character walks through a club and sees a man emerging from another man's stomach, or when a character's skin seems to melt off his face. The violence isgrisly and explicit, and the whole thing is imbued with a strongbody horror vibe. The other pleasure is the interplay between Hurt's character and Riley's. The two have a natural chemistry, and thefilm does a good job of making their relationship feel nuanced and complicated. The twists and turns of the plot are mostly logical, and the film'soverall trajectory is satisfying. \"Control\" is unlikely to become a cult classic like Cronenberg's \"The Brood\" or \"The Fly,\" but it's a morethan serviceable substitute. It's a genre film that takes enough risks to keep things interesting, and features just enough psychological depth to keep things think-provoking.","label":"ai"}

{"id":268,"text":"It is commonly thought that quantum effects play a crucial role in quantum key distribution (QKD). This myth is widespread, even among the leading researchers, causing the quantum foundations of the field to be frequently discussed with less accuracy and reliability than is often considered. In order to clarify this position we analyze the role of quantum effects in the most popular QKD schemes and show that quantum effects are unnecessary for the task at hand. Quantum key distribution is essentially a problem of secure information transfer and quantum effects, as long as they are not related to the noise affecting the communication channel, are only needed when some extra source of noise in the form of an eavesdropper is present. The results presented in this article may shed new light on the current contraversy regarding quantum cryptography and its foundations, giving new impetus to its development. The paper appears to be based on a talk given at the 2008 World Information Security Conference in New York City. I would be glad to have people comment on it here, especially concerning any errors therein.

The protest was coordinated by the Patidar Anamat Andolan Sabha (PAAS), a group providing reservations for Patidars in government jobs and academic institutions. The protest became dangerous after the police failed to stop the protesters from marching to the headquarters of the Maharashtra Chief Secretary Anandiben Singh. The protesters pelted rocks at the police and set many cars on fire. The police reacted by firing teargas and lathi-charging the crowds. The unrest intensified for the first two days with numerous demonstrations and demonstrations being held throughout the nation. The protesters demanded that the state government fulfill their demands or else they could continue the agitation. The state administration, however, decided to bow down to the demands and then tried to crack down on the protesters. Vijay Singh was convicted on treason charges and imprisoned for almost two years. The agitation eventually came to an end after the state legislature declared 10% reservation for socially backward classes, which excluded the Patidars.

{"id":272,"text":"'Shaun of the Dead' is not only the best zombie film I've seen in a long time, it's simply the best film I've seen in a long time, period! It's clever, witty, sweet and nasty, and at times bloody and terrifying, too. Of course, I thought it was quite impossible to get lost in a film that George Romero himself has admitted to being a fan of. It's really not so bad, this Shaun, but he has no ambition, prefers the company of his inert, flatulent, video-game-obsessed slob of a roommate, Ed, to everyone else, and as if that weren't enough, the dead have risen from the dead and are roaming the earth, looking for human flesh to eat. Shaun notices this too late, but he is almost a zombie himself, caught up in his own thoughts, wandering past the rotting corpses that fill the streets of Britain. Even news bulletins don't get through to him, because he (a truly funny scene) quickly switches from one channel to another and with each change of station learns the grim news of what is happening in the world. But when he and Ed finally realize what's happening, it becomes a matter of hurrying to save his mother, save Liz and get to the pub, where they can hide and wait for the dead to die down with a pint and a cigarette. fairly well as it goes, but if you're really determined, you can do anything: the undead roommate, the infected who gnaw on you as you walk, the bickering between the two friends, and Ed's ringing mobile phone... but you just have to stick to it. It should be seen side by side with Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead', because both offer a very smart and sarcastic commentary on our zombified society and make hardly any difference between living and dead. We didn't have a lot of gore here, but there was one unexpected and Savini-like moment when the zombies tore a living man to pieces, pulled out his intestines, tore off his limbs... I was completely taken aback and couldn't help but stare, the grotesque effect was completely convincing and even, for me, who generally hates gore, surprisingly effective. As a low-budget film, the zombies are quite formidable and 'Shaun' has some scary moments. There are also some tender moments between Shaun and his parents... or rather stepfather, because as the dead surround him, he has to become more mature and more adult. Woods's 'Dead of the Dead', he only laughs when his mother, Liz, explains to him that the boyfriend is a bit of a slag and that he should be called Ed. I don't want to spoil the wonderful ending of 'Shaun', but I can only say that the living dead are not exempt from the commodification of pop culture, and that no matter how much a loved one dies, games live forever. GO SEE THIS MOVIE! I haven't seen a film this good for a long time. TEN STARS!","label":"human"}

Both nations have maintained significant levels of political, Economic and cultural exchange since the 16th century. Political Relations\nThe British government recognised the independence of Brazil in 1822, following its separation from Portugal. Over the following decades, Britain and Brazil established friendly relations, with the two nations sharing common goals such as opposing slavery and promoting democracy. In the mid-19th century, Brazil became a major ally of Britain during the Crimean War, and later, in the early 20th century, both countries signed the Entente Cordiale which helped to strengthen their alliance. In recent years, Brazil and Britain have continued to maintain close ties, with both nations working together on issues ranging from climate change to terrorism. Queen Elizabeth II has visited Brazil three times and Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff has visited the UK twice. Despite this, there have been some tensions between the two nations over issues such as trade disputes and criticism of Brazil's human rights record. Economic Relations\nBritain was one of the first European countries to establish trading links with Brazil after its independence. Today, Brazil is an important trading partner for the United Kingdom, with bilateral trade worth PS7.5 billion annually. The two countries work closely together on issues related to investment, mining, and energy production. One of the largest British companies operating in Brazil is BP, which operates in the oil and gas industry. Cultural Exchange\nThere is a strong cultural exchange between Brazil and the UK. The Portuguese language spoken by the majority of Brazilians is derived from Latin and influenced by many languages such English. There is also a significant cultural exchange between Brazil and the UK due to migration patterns, particularly in areas such as music and entertainment.

Its title track had drawn huge radio hits in Europe and South America; it reached number one almost everywhere but in the west where it finished at number 48. The pair wrote about how big artists shouldn't write about race, writing a touching song that reflected on \"racism so ugly even white boys can see through it.\" But they did not go out and sing about race directly. Instead they were reflective on nature of their relationship to each other since meeting in seventh grade in Queens' Flatbush area during elementary school, how they all grew up together while also talking about family, drug addiction and love woes.

{"id":282,"text":"In this paper, we propose a novel approach for partial labeled gastric tumor segmentation using patch-based reiterative learning. Gastric tumor segmentation is a crucial step in computer-aided diagnosis and treatment planning for gastric cancer, but it remains challenging task due to complexity and variability of gastric tumors. To address this challenge, we introduce patch-based reiterative learning framework that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to improve accuracy and efficiency of tumor segmentation. Our approach consists of two main components: patch-based feature extraction module and a reiterative learning module. The patch-based feature extraction module extracts discriminative features from small patches of the gastric tumor images, while the reiterative learning module refines the segmentation results through iterative updates of the model parameters. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of 100 partial labeled gastric tumor images and compare it with state-of-the-art segmentation methods. The results show that our approach outperforms compared methods in terms of segmentation accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, our approach achieves average Dice similarity coefficient of 0.83 and mean absolute error of 0.12, which represents significant improvement over compared methods. Additionally, our approach demonstrates robustness to different types of gastric tumors and can handle complex cases with multiple tumors or irregular shapes. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: (1) we propose a novel patch-based reiterative learning framework for partial labeled gastric tumor segmentation, which leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to improve segmentation accuracy and efficiency; (2) we introduce patch-based feature extraction module that extracts discriminative features from small patches of gastric tumor images; (3) we evaluate our approach on a dataset of 100 partial labeled gastric tumor images and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art segmentation methods.

{"id":284,"text":"The first episode covers the period from the betrothal of Hrutr Herjolfsson and Unnr to the ugly legacy of their divorce. We are shown Hrutr's exploits in Norway, where he gains honour at court and in battle, but he ruins his subsequent marriage by becomeing the lover of the aging queen mother Gunnhildr. When he denies having a woman in Iceland, she curses him so that he is unable to consummate his marriage. After Unnr divorces him, he retains the dowry by challenging Unnr's father, Mordr, to combat. Mordr refuses, as he knows Hrutr's reputation and that he will lose the fight. Becasue of this, Hrutr keeps the dowry. While this conforms to Icelandic law, it offends justice. The first chapter gives one of Hrutr's insights when he comments of his beatiful neice, \"I do not know how thieves' eyes came into the family\". The saga next follows this neice, Hallgerdr, through her first two marriages. Both husbands die by the axe of Hallgerdr's doting, brutish foster-father,Thjostolfr. Hallgerdr provokes the first death but not the second, although it follows from a disagreement between her and her husband. It is Hrutr who, despite the family ties, avenges the death by killing Thjostolfr. Gunnarr Hamundarson and Njall Thorgeirsson are now introduced. Gunnarr is a man of outstanding physical prowess, and Njall has outstanding sagacity; they are close friends. When Gunnarr is obliged to revive Unnr's dowry-claim against Hrutr, Njall gives him the means to do so. By skillful play-acting, Gunnarr begins the legal process in Hrutr's own house. He follows Hrutr's doubtful example when it comes to court, and Hrutr, who has previously won by threat of violence, loses to a threat of violence. Despite his humiliation, he sees future links with Gunnarr. This comes about when Gunnarr returns with honours from a trip to Scandinavia. He goes to the Althing - the annual assembly - in splendour, and meets Hallgerdr. They are impressed with one another and are soon betrothed, despite Hrutr's warnings about Hallgerdr's character, and Njall's misgivings. Hrutr and Njall are proven right when Hallgerdr clashes with Njal's wife, Bergthora. Hallgerdr charms a number of dubious characters into killing members of Njall's household and the spirited Bergthora arranges vengeance. After each killing, their husbands make financial settlements according to the status of the victims. The fifth victim is Thordr, foster-father of Njall's sons. Thrainn Sigfusson, Gunnarr's uncle and Hallgerdr's son-in-law, accompanies the killers. When the feud ends and settlements are made, Thrainn's presance at that killing later causes conflict. Hallgerdr now uses one of her slaves, Melkolfr, to burgle the home of a churlish man named Otkell. Gunnarr imediately seeks to make amends, but his handsome offers are not accepted. A lawsuit is started against him which, with Njall's help, he wins, gaining grate honour. However, while remonstrating with Hallgerdr about the burglary, Gunnarr slaps her. This is followed by Otkell accidentaly wounding Gunnarr. Insult follows injury and Gunnarr reluctantly goes to avenge himself. With belated help from his brother Kolskeggr, he kills Otkell and his companions. Under Njall's influence a new settlement is arranged, and Gunnarr's reputation grows. Njall warns him that this will be the start of his career of killings. Next, Gunnarr accepts a challenge to a horse-fight from a man called Starkadr. In the course of the fight, his opponents cheat, and Gunnarr find himself in a fresh squabble. Njall tries to mediate but Thorgeir Starkadsson refuses to accept it. On a journey with his two brothers, Gunnarr is ambushed by Starkadr and his allies. In the battle, fourteen attackers and Gunnarr's brother Hjortr are killed. Worming through all this is Unnr's son, Mordr Valgardsson. Mordr envies and hates Gunnarr, and uses other men to attain his aims. He has learned that Njall prophesied that Gunnarr will die if he kills twice in the same family. He instigates an attack on Gunnarr by persons dissatisfied by the settlement. Again, Gunnarr wins the fight, but he kills a second man in the same family. The settlement that follows requires that Gunnarr and Kolskeggr leave Iceland for three years. Arrangements are made for exile. But as Gunnarr leaves home, he looks homeward and, touched by the beauty of his homeland, resolves not to leave Iceland, thus becomeing an outlaw. He goes about as though nothing has changed but his enemies, Mordr among them, seek revenge. He defends himself in his home untill his bowstring is cut. Hallgerdr refuses to give him strands of her hair to restring his bow; this is in revenge for the slap he once gave her. Some readers choose to interpret this episode as her forgiveness since human hair is unusable as bowstring; i.e. he asks for something he knows is useless and she answers by denying as revenge, fully knowing too. Gunnarr's enemies resist Mordrs proposal to burn him in the house as shameful, but eventually they take the roof off to get to Gunnarr. Njall's son Skarp-Hedinn assists Hogni Gunnarsson in some acts of vengeance before a settlement is achieved. Scandinavian rulers honor two Icelandic expeditions: those of Thrainn Sigfusson and of Njall's two younger sons. Both return with enhanced honor, but also with companions. Thrainn brings back the malevolent Betrayal-Hrappr; the sons of Njall the noble Kari Solmundarson, who marries their sister. But Njall's sons also bring back a grievance, blaming Thrainn for the way in which the de facto ruler of Norway, Jarl Hakon, has treated them while looking for Hrappr, who had been hidden by Thrainn. While Njall says they have been foolish in raising the matter, he advises them to publicise it so that it will be seen as a matter of honor. Thrain refuses a settlement, and his retainers, including Hallgerdr, on her last appearance, insult them. The most dramatic of the saga's battles follows. Njall's sons, with Kari, prepare to ambush Thrainn and his followers. There is a bridge of ice over the river between them. Skarp-Hedinn overtakes his brothers, leaps the river, and slides on the ice past Thrainn, beheading him in passing. Between them the attackers kill four men, including Hrappr. Thrainn's brother, Ketill, has married Njall's daughter, and between them they bring about a settlement. Wishing to stop further contention, Njall adopts Thrainn's son Hoskuldr as his foster-son. Hoskuldr grows up in Njall's household, and is loved and favoured by him. When he is fully grown, Njall attempts to find a suitable wife for him, Hildigunnr. However, she refuses, saying that she will only marry Hoskuldr if he becomes a chieftain. Njall manages to get Hoskuldr a chieftaincy by instituting the Fifth Court at the Althing, and Hoskuldr and Hildigunnr are married. At this point the saga recounts the conversion of Iceland to Christianity in AD 999. Mordr Valgardsson now finds Hoskuldr to be such a succesful cheif that his own chieftaincy is declining. He sets the sons of Njall against Hoskuldr; the tragedy of the saga is that they are so susceptible to his promptings that they, with Mordr and Kari, murder him as he sows in his field. As one character says, \"Hoskuldr was killed for less than no reason; all men mourn his death; but none more than Njal, his foster-father\". Flosi, the uncle of Hoskuldr's wife, takes revenge against the killers, and seeks help from powerful chieftains. He is pressured (against his better judgement) by Hildigunnr to accept only blood vengeance. Njall's sons find themselves at the Althing having to plead for help. Skarp-Hedinn has become grimly fatalistic, and insults many who might help them. After some legal sparring, arbitrators are chosen, including Snorri godi, who proposes a weregild of three times the normal compensation for Hoskuldr. This is so much that it can only be paid if the arbitrators, and many at the Althing, contribute. The grat collection is gathered, and Njall adds a gift of a fancy cloak. Flosi claims to be insulted by the offer of a unisex garment (an insult from Skarp-Hedinn also adds fuel to the fire) and the settlement breaks down. Everyone leaves the Althing and prepares, amid portents and prophecies, for the showdown. A hundred men descend on Njall's home, Bergthorsknoll (Bergthorshvall), to find it defended by about thirty. Any victory for Flosi will be at some cost. But Njall suggests that his sons defend from within the house, and they, while realizing that this is futile, agree. Flosi and his men set fire to the building. Both the innocent and the guilty are surrounded. Flosi allows the women to leave but beheads Helgi Njalsson, who attempts to escape disguised as a woman. Although Flosi invites Njall and Bergthora to leave, they refuse, preferring to die with their sons and their grandson Thordr (the son of Kari). Eventually eleven people die, not including Kari who escapes under cover of the smoke by running along the beam of the house. Flosi knows that Kari will exact vengeance for the burning. At the Althing, both sides gather. Flosi bribes Eyjolfr Bolverksson, one of the finest lawyers in Iceland, into taking over the case, while his opponents blackmail Mordr Valgardsson into prosecuting, advised by Thorhallr, Njall's foster-son, who was trained in the law by Njall, but is kept away from the proceedings by an infected leg. There is a legal joust between the parties. Eventually, when his legal action seems to be failing, Thorhallr lances his boil with his spear and begins fighting. Flosi's men are driven back untill Snorri separates the parties. In the confusion, several are killed including Ljotr, Flosi's brother-in-law. Ljotr's father, Hallr of Sida, takes advantage of the truce to appeal for peace, and seeks no compensation for his son. Moved by this, all but Kari and Njall's nephew Thorgeir reach a settlement, while everyone contributes to Ljotr's weregild, which in the end amounts to a quadruple compensation. The burners are exiled. Before the sons of Sigfus reach home, Kari attacks them, and most of the rest of the saga describes his vengeance for the burning. He is supported by Thorgeir and an attractive anti-hero named Bjorn. He pursues them to Orkney and Wales. The most dramatic moment is when he breaks into the earl's hall in Orkney and kills a man who is giving a slanderous account of those killed at the burning. After a pilgrimage to Rome, Flosi returns to Iceland. Kari follows, and is shipwrecked near Flosi's home. Testing Flosi's nobility he goes to him for help, and they arrange a final peace. Kari marries Hoskuldr's widow. Finally, there is a full reconciliation.","label":"human"}

Early life\nSelam Seyoum Woldemariam was born in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in 1954 to a director-teacher, Seyoum Woldemariam Kidane, and an assistant teacher-housewife, Tsirha Nemariam. While in Ethiopia, his father worked in a school run by American missionaries. The family owned an acoustic guitar, and while each of his siblings tried to learn, he was the most disciplined in his musical study. He was 10 or 11 years old when he went to Asmara with his family. During the mid-1960s, Woldemariam formed a church music quintet choir group in Asmara at Geza Kenisha, which became popular and pulled hundreds of followers to the church where they performed. Later, they included a Swedish drummer but the sound eventually became too noisy for the elderly congregation and they had to discontinue playing. Woldemariam moved to Addis Ababa in 1972 and finished high school. This was at the height of the Ethiopian Civil War and classes in most schools, including Addis Ababa University were disrupted. Soon, all higher learning institutions were closed, while students and staff were forced to join the national campaign (Idget Behibret). With the Addis Ababa University closed, Woldemariam could no longer continue his education.","label":"human"}
{"id":287,"text":"ThisMovie is a completely enjoyable, physically impressive, and thought-provoking documentary that explores deep into the dark corners of Victorian London's cities. The film is stunning, with vibrant colors and elaborate sets that transport viewers forward in time. The cast deliver stellar performances, especially Martha Morris as Kate Morgan, the film's fiery and independent heroine who gets herself embroiled in Jack the Ripper's sinister web. Johnny Depp gives his usual humor to Detective Abberline, the jaded policeman tasked with capturing the murderer, but nevertheless gives unexpected layers of depth and vulnerability. Peter Holm gets special note for his spine-tingling depiction of the creepy and strange psychic, Mr John Gull. The story itself is engaging, bringing the viewer on winding journey through England's filthy underbelly, examining the poverty, crime, and madness that fuels Jack the Ripper's destructive rage. While some might find many elements of the storytelling far-fetched or too sensationalized, I found them beneficial in bringing tension and atmosphere to this compelling drama. My only major criticism lies in the pace which can sometimes feel erratic; some sequences can be tightened up without compromising any important details. However, From Hell's major problems are more than compensated by its haunting visuals and interesting characters, making it quite worth seeing - even if you have an interest in gothic thriller or contemporary crime drama.","label":"ai"}
{"id":288,"text":"Hemoglobin Barts, abbreviated Hb Barts, is abnormal type of hemoglobin that consists of four gamma globins. It is moderately insoluble, and therefore accumulates in red blood cells. Hb Barts has an extremely high affinity for oxygen, so it cannot release oxygen to the tissue. Therefore, this makes it an inefficient oxygen carrier. As embryo develops, it begins to produce alpha-globins at weeks 5-6 of development. When both of HBA1 and HBA2 genes which code for alpha globins becomes dysfunctional, the affected fetuses will have difficulty in synthesizing functional hemoglobin. As a result, gamma chains will accumulate and form four gamma globins. These gamma globins bind to form hemoglobin Barts. It is produced in disease alpha-thalassemia and in the most severe of cases, it is the only form of hemoglobin in circulation. In this situation, a fetus will develop hydrops fetalis and normally die before or shortly after birth, unless intrauterine blood transfusion is performed. Since hemoglobin Barts is elevated in alpha thalassemia, it can be measured, providing useful screening test for this disease in some populations.","label":"human"}

{"id":293,"text":"(review courtesy of IMDB.com) I've never heard of this director before, nor does any other reviewer that has ever seen this film, but it makes my top ten list! The plot: The emperor Hui (Peter Mayhew) is dying from natural causes after his wife died suddenly many years ago...and only two family members can play a role in what's to become a bloodless coup against him and his son, Huan (Benedict Wong), by ruling his own dynasty as heir apparrent! But when a girl named Wang (Lung Shuah) sees Huan with an older man (Yao Ming), she assumes he's been sleeping with her father or brother...in China it's against social norms, even for royal families. She becomes close friends with Wang while becomeing increasingly attached to him; he seems like a decent young man, no wonder she fell in love. When Wang goes away on an overseas job as Wang's tour guide, he learns from Huan that their child will only be born on April 1st, and they will spend one-fifth of that day together before Huan dies. The final scene depicts a funeral procession, then a sunrise over Beijing, all set over a Chinese opera arrangement using the words \"Long Live Your Majesty! Long Live Heaven's Ruler!\". If only this were just another Disney fairy tale! Alas, in actuality this is a darkly comic film filled with political satire and twists based off an orignal story called \"Zhang Juejia\", which was written not so long before the Communist Revolution. That means allmost all elements were changed and put into the script months prior through extensive research. The action sequences are especially gruesome. Not only do the characters use karate moves, kicks and punches much more violently than we might expect to see at first glance - but also, this part isn't supposed to be easy at all if you want to get the end result right! And of course, being real life there are times where these movies just totally take themselves too seriously while others are far more humerous. However, none of those films can quite compete up into the upper echelon of my Top 10, and they make me consider how important this particular author's work actually is. As far as entertainment factor, however, the movie is absolutely top notch: highly suspenseful with amazing fight scenes, a wide variety of special effects and music including songs","label":"ai"}

Heaped in the hollows of the grove, the autumn leaves lie dead;\nThey rustle to the eddying gust, and to the rabbit's tread;\nThe robin and the wren are flown, and from the shrubs the jay,\nAnd from the wood-top calls the crow through all the gloomy day. Where are the flowers, the fair young flowers, that lately sprang and stood\nIn brighter light and softer airs, a beauteous sisterhood?

And now, when comes the calm mild day, as still such days will come,\nTo call the squirrel and the bee from out their winter home;\nWhen the sound of dropping nuts is heard, though all the trees are still,\nAnd twinkle in the smoky light the waters of the rill,\nThe south wind searches for the flowers whose fragrance late he bore,\nAnd sighs to find them in the wood and by the stream no more. And then I think of one who in her youthful beauty died,\nThe fair meek blossom that grew up and faded by my side. In the cold moist earth we laid her, when the forests cast the leaf,\nAnd we wept that one so lovely should have a life so brief:\nYet not unmeet it was that one, like that young friend of ours,\nSo gentle and so beautiful, should perish with the flowers.","label":"human"}

It came out in 1980, earned Robert De Niro a Best Actor Academy Award, And was marked down as another solid triumph by director Martin Scorsese, whose previous 1976 outing with De Niro earned them both critical acclaim (and for De niro, an Oscar nomination, although he would actually earn an Oscar For \"Raging Bull\" four years later).<br\/><br\/>It dwindled in production hell for quite some time, with Scorsese's drug use halting production and only the duo's Strong Willpower that Kept the project moving ahead. It was after De Niro read boxer Jake LaMotta's memoirs That he knew he wanted to make the film, so Scorsese and De Niro turned to Paul Schrader for a script. Schrader, who had previously written \"Taxi Driver\" (1976), agreed, and wrote the Screenplay for them. The rest is history.<br\/><br\/>\"Raging Bull\" has Often been regarded as the greatest film of the 80s. To be honest, I'm not so Sure about that, since various genres offer different feelings and emotions (comparing this To a comedy might seem rather silly). but to say it is one of the most powerful films of all time would be no gross overstatement -- it is superb film-making at its finest.<br\/><br\/>De Niro gained 60 pounds to play LaMotta, which was an all-time record at the time (later beaten by Vincent D'Onofrio, who gained 70 Pounds for Stanley Kubrick's \"Full Metal Jacket\"). His physical transformation is on-par with any great screen makeover, especially the most recent, ranging from Willem Dafoe in \"Shadow of the Vampire\" to Charlize Theron in \"monster.\" In addition, co-star Joe Pesci also lost weight For his role of Joey, LaMotta's short, eccentric brother. The greatest scene in the film is when LaMotta accuses his brother of having an affair with his wife. The tension is raw, the dialogue amazing, and the overall Intensity electrifying.<br\/><br\/>The film is most often Compared to \"Rocky,\" more than any other, apparently because they both concern a certain Level of boxing. As much as I absolutely adore \"Rocky,\" \"Raging Bull\" is a deeper, more Realistic film. But whereas \"Raging Bull\" is raw, \"Rocky\" is inspiring, and that is one of the reasons I do not think these two very different motion pictures deserve comparison, for The simple fact that they are entirely separate from one another. The only connecting thread is the apparently central theme of boxing, which is used as a theme in \"Rocky,\" and a backdrop in \"raging Bull.\" They're entirely different motion pictures -- one uplifting, the other somewhat depressing -- and The people who try to decide which is better need to seriously re-evaluate their reasons for doing so. They both Succeed splendidly well at what they are trying to do, and that's all I have to say about their so-called connection.<br\/><Br\/>De Niro, who could justifiably be called the greatest actor of all time, is at the top of his game here. In \"Taxi Driver\" he displayed a top-notch performance. He wasn't just playing Travis Bickle -- he was Travis Bickle. And Here he Is Jake LaMotta, the infamous boxer known for his abusive Life style and somewhat paranoid delusions during his reign as world middleweight boxing champion, 1949 - 1951. Throughout the film, he beats his wife (played expertly and convincingly by the 19-year-old Cathy Moriarty), convinced That she is cheating on him, and that is more or Less what the film is truly about. The boxing is just what he does for a Living, and could be considered as a way to release some of his Deeper, harbored anger.<br\/><br\/>LaMotta has a close relationship with Joey, His Brother, And their interaction is often what elevates the film above others of its genre. The dialogue is great, close to the perfection of Quentin Tarantino's \"Pulp Fiction,\" rich in That rapid-fire filthy Language And brutal insults. Pesci, who was On the verge of quitting showbiz at the time of pre-production, Was spotted By De Niro in a cheap B-movie named \"The Death Collector\" (1975), a.k.a. \"Family Business,\" a truly horrid film that nevertheless showcased an early sign of things to come for Pesci. De Niro wanted him for the movie and his premonition was either very lucky or very wise -- this is one of the best performances of Pesci's entire career.<br\/><br\/>Scorsese shot the film in muted black and white, portraying a certain era of depression and misery. To make the blood show up on screen during the occasional fight scenes, Scorsese used Hershey's Syrup -- which is an interesting tidbit of trivia for any aspiring film-making planning on filming a violent movie in black and white. But how often does that happen?<br\/><br\/>This is certainly one of the most intense films Scorsese has directed, and one of the most important of his career. Along with \"Taxi Driver,\" it is an iconic motion picture that will stand the test of time for years and years to come. <br\/><br\/>Scorsese and De Niro's partnership over the years has resulted in some of the most Influential and utterly amazing motion pictures Of all time: \"mean Streets,\" \"Taxi Driver,\" \"The King of Comedy,\" \"Goodfellas\" and \"Casino\" come to mind almost instantly. But perhaps the One single title that will be remembered as their most Daring effort is \"Raging Bull,\" a motion picture so utterly exhilarating that it defies description. It is simply a masterpiece for the mind and senses, leaving You knocked out cold after its brutal one-two punch. If I had to assemble a list of required viewing, this would be Up there towards the top.","label":"human"}
{"id":302,"text":"In the sewers of Deptford there lurks a dark presence that fills the tunnels with fear: Jupiter, a dark god known only by his evil, no one really knows who he is except for his lieutenant Morgan his glowing eyes seen behind a dark \"portal\" in the tunnel wall. The rats worship him and do his dark bidding. The Deptford mice, who worship the Green Mouse who brings Spring, are aware of Jupiter's evil presence in the tunnels. One of the mice, Albert Brown, is pulled through a grate into the sewers by the dark enchantments that Jupiter has woven there. He meets a cheeky mouse from the city, Piccadilly, also lost inside the lair of the rats. When Albert is captured by Morgan, a Cornish, piebald rat with a stump for a tail and rings through his ears (none other than Jupiter's lieutenant) and brought to Jupiter, Piccadilly escapes into Albert's home, known as the Skirtings, where he meets a large number of friends. Firstly, there is Audrey Brown, Albert's day-dreaming daughter who hates Piccadilly for surviving where her father did not. Then there is Arthur Brown, Audrey's plump and funny brother. There is also simple fieldmouse William Scuttle or 'Twit' and his cousin, the sickly albino runt, Oswald Chitter. Along with the old Midship-mouse, Thomas Triton and Gwen Brown, the mother of Audrey and Arthur, they venture into the sewers to banish Jupiter from the world. The Rat God, however, has an evil plan to unleash the Black Death on the world once more, ridding it of humans and enabling him to conquer it. After a tense-confrontation with Jupiter in this throne-room during which the malevolent deity is revealed to be a monstrous cat, Audrey defeats the Dark Lord by flinging her mousebrass at him. The talisman explodes and Jupiter falls into the water that is rapidly flooding his chamber. The spirits of the many mice and rats he has tortured and devoured then rise up and drag the dark god down to a watery grave. Audrey glimpses her father among the legion of spirits as they depart and despairs, realising that he is truly dead. The sewer floods and the Black Death is destroyed. Thankful that they are alive and resolving to celebrate Jupiter's downfall once they return home, the mice begin the journey back to the surface but as they leave, Orfeo the bat foretells doom.","label":"human"}

{"id":304,"text":"Vera Zvonareva will replace Maria Sharapova in the finals of the WTA tournament next week, but there are questions about Svetlana Kuznetsova, a runner-up in Moscow, after the scandal with methylhexane, which is forbidden in Russia, but is allowed by WADA in other countries, such as Britain and the United States. The representative of Kuznetsova, confirmed by BBC Sport, said last month that her agent received a notice of a negative doping test, but at the same time it was pointed out that there was no conviction. But the September issue of the Spanish newspaper, the Marca, said that the tennis federation in Spain, the judicial authority, had already been informed by WADA that Kuznetsov supposedly had a positive test at the Madrid Challenger tournament in early May. As for the suspension of Kuznetsova, there is none yet, but the alleged concern of the British anti-doping agency was that the substance could have been used as a stimulant, not just as a nasal decongestant. If Kuznetsova does not receive a new letter from WADA before she travels to Tokyo on Sunday to defend her title, it would seem that she is ready to play in the first round against Sam Stosur on October 26. Otherwise, if there is still a case, the federation of the international tennis federation will have to help her with the help of WADA. It is known that there are five vacancies at the ITF for five players each year, and that they can be used by those athletes from certain countries who, in the face of difficulties in the local system, can request assistance from the judicial authorities here.","label":"ai"}

{"id":307,"text":"Last April, Kelly Holmes spoke to the BBC Sport website about her loneliness, her fight to stay fit and her decision not to contest both the 800m and 1500m at the Olympics. It just goes to show even the most meticulous and measured athletes cannot predict what fate has in store for them. Four months later, Holmes stormed to double Olympic gold and has since been made a Dame, won the BBC Sport Personality of the Year and written a book whilst still finding time to coach aspiring athletes. With so much time spent in the spotlight, Holmes has increasingly dropped hints that her ambition on the track has begun to wilt. And when asked about her plans for both the indoor and outdoor seasons ahead, the 34-year-old has repeatedly chosen to tick the \"don't know\" box. Holmes has now pulled out of this weekend's European Indoor Championships, where she was selected for both the 800m and 1500m, because of a hamstring injury. But should we be surprised if the Olympic champion over both those distances decides she just does not feel like racing anymore? \"Well, it's a lot easier being the double Olympic champion, being feted by everybody, than training to be at the top in middle distance running,\" points out former Olympian and BBC pundit Steve Cram. \"You have to have a real strong desire to carry on doing it even if you're very talented.\" Holmes' drive and determination have always been unquestionable - that is the reason she has battled back from a string of injuries that threatened to see her finish her career empty-handed. But alarm bells start ringing when the Kent athlete begins questioning herself. \"Will I have as much commitment, desire and energy to go through a major championship?\" Holmes asked in the New Year. \"That is what I don't know.\" At 34, Holmes will also be aware that time is running out. US 400m and 200m legend Michael Johnson, a five-time Olympic gold medallist, retired shortly after his 34th birthday as did Britain's double Olympic champion decathlete Daley Thompson. The physical demands of the day-to-day grind will only get harder for Holmes, who has already admitted she \"doesn't like the training anymore.\" Whilst out on the circuit the allure of defeating a double Olympic champion will spur her opponents on. Holmes will not want to needlessly suffer the indignity of being beaten. Unless she is certain she has a strong chance of winning any race, she will not step onto the track. But if the Kent athlete finds the form that fuelled her ambitions last summer, there are more prizes up for grabs. The day after completing her double in Athens, the 34-year-old revealed she would still like to win her first indoors title. Holmes' wish could easily be met in Madrid before she goes on to prepare for the outdoor season where there are still scores to be settled, such as a first gold at the World Championships in Helsinki. There is just one small truth which could gnaw away at Holmes' motivation - the realisation that no matter how hard she trains, nothing she wins now can surpass her achievements in Athens. On the other hand, if those achievements cannot be matched shouldn't they be at least shared and celebrated? \"You don't get the chance very often in your career to step onto the track as the double Olympic champion,\" agreed Cram. \"You want to be able to take your bow in front of the fans because it's a fantastic feeling. \"I think deep down Kelly wants to run. I think she will compete and run races on the circuits but whether or not she runs in the major championships is much less certain.\" Athletics fans had every reason to believe they would see the new-look Kelly Holmes tearing up the track again. After her Olympic glory she emphatically denied she planned to retire. So, why is Holmes dragging her heels about making a decision on where, when or whether to even bother competing again? \"That's just Kelly,\" explains Cram. \"She's always been like that. \"She enjoys people trying to guess what she is going to do next. She knows every time she makes a pronouncement now it's headline news. \"Kelly has to figure out for herself what it is she wants and that will be based on athletics decisions, whether she can be competitive, if she is fit enough to put her neck on the line. \"And if she decides not to run again, no-one is going to turn round and say 'you're making the wrong decision.'\"","label":"human"}

{"id":313,"text":"Although this movie admittedly had a limited release in the United States, it certainly deserves a better fate than it received. Roberto Benigni, who also directed the movie, plays the lead role of 1900, a handsome sailor who, as a young boy, is orphaned after his mother is killed shortly after landing in America. The boy is then taken aboard a ship bound for New Orleans, where he meets Neville, played by Danny DeVito, who takes pity on the motherless boy and teaches him everything he knows about being a sailor. Cross-cut throughout the movie is another narrative, in which 1900, now a man, plays the violin on the deck of the same ship, which is, unbeknownst to him, destined to crash into a huge storm and sink. As the ship sinks, 1900 plays his violin in the ship's orchestra, while remembering the events of his life that brought him to that point. At its core, this movie is a love story. The first object of 1900's love is his dead mother, whom he attempts to honor throughout the movie by remembering the lessons she taught him about always staying close to the ground (so you can never be knocked down) and never denying an emotion (by crying, laughing, or otherwise). The second object of his affections is a beatiful, free-spirited carnival performer, played by Sharon Stone. DeVito's character serves as a sort of matchmaker, by introducing the young boy to the young woman, and the three form a loving triangle that lasts throughout the movie. What makes this movie work is Benigni's uncompromising vision. This is a movie about love and loss, about destiny, and about the power of memory. Some scenes are introduced suddenly, with no explanation, such as an affair between 1900 and a married woman played by Vanessa Redgrave, which seems to come out of nowhere. Benigni seems to want to capture the chaos, randomness, and mysteries of life, rather than attempting to give them order and structure. The result is a movie that is ethereal, otherworldly, and hauntingly beatiful. Another suprise is the acting talents of Benigni himself. An accomplished comedian and director in Italy, this was his first major attempt at acting in an English-language film, and he proves that he possesses a certain screen charisma that is altogether different from his character in \"Life Is Beatiful.\" He is equally effective wether he is playing the young boy or the older man, and he manages to communicate the character's rich","label":"ai"}

{"id":323,"text":"Outcome primacy is a psychological phenomenon that describes lasting effects on a subject's behavior based on the outcome of first experiences with a given task or decision. It was found that this outcome primacy can account for much of the underweighting of rare events in experience based decisions, where participants apparently underestimate small probabilities (in contrast to prospect theory where people tend to overestimate low probabilities, when lotteries are described). Modelling\nBehaviour in this task can be modelled using a standard, model-free reinforcement learning algorithm. In this model, the values of the different actions are learned over time and are used to determine the next action according to a predefined action-selection rule. It was shown that a substantial effect of first experience on behaviour is consistent with the reinforcement learning model if one assumes that the outcome of first experience resets the values of the experienced actions, but not if symmetric initial conditions are assumed.","label":"human"}

{"id":325,"text":"Gadgets are cheaper, smaller and more common than ever. But that just means we are more likely to lose them. In London alone over the past six months more than 63,000 mobile phones have been left in the back of black cabs, according to a survey. That works out at about three phones per cab. Over the same period almost 5,000 laptops and 5,800 PDAs such as Palms and Pocket PCs were left in licensed cabs. Even the great and good are not immune to losing their beloved gadgets. Jemima Khan reportedly left her iPod, phone and purse in a cab and asked for them to be returned to her friend who turned out to be Hugh Grant. As the popularity of portable gadgets has grown, and we trust more of our lives to them, we seem to be forgetting them in ever larger numbers. The numbers of lost laptops has leapt by 71% in the last three years. This has left Londoners, or those travelling by cab in the capital, as the world's best at losing laptops, according to the research by the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association and Pointsec, a mobile-data backup firm. More than twice as many laptops were left in the back of black cabs in London as in any of the nine other cities (Helsinki, Oslo, Munich, Paris, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Chicago and Sydney) where the research into lost and found gadgets was carried out. By contrast Danes were most adept at losing mobile phones being seven times more likely to leave it behind in a cab than travellers in Germans, Norwegians and Swedes. Top of the range phones can carry enormous amounts of data - enough to hold hundreds of pictures or thousands of contact details. Given that few people back up the data on their PC it is a fair bet that even fewer do so with the phone they carry around. You could be losing a fair chunk of your life in the back of that cab not least because many people collect numbers on their phone that they do not have anywhere else. Equally, phones let you navigate through contacts by name so many people have completely forgotten their friends' numbers and could not reconstruct them if they had to. This growing habit of losing gadgets explains the rise of firms such as Retrofone which lets people buy a cheap old-fashioned phone to replace the tiny, shiny expensive one they have just lost. Briton's growing love of phones has also led to the creation of the Mobile Equipment National Database that lets you register the unique ID number of your phone so it can be returned to you in the event of it being lost or stolen. According to statistics 50% of all muggings and snatch theft offences involve mobiles. Millions of gadgets are now logged in the database and organisations such as Transport For London regularly consult it when trying to re-unite folk with their phones and other gadgets. For the drivers, finding a mobile in the back of their cab is one of the more pleasant things many have found. The survey of what else has been left behind included a harp, a dog, a hamster and a baby.","label":"human"}

{"id":328,"text":"A superpixel technique was demonstrated for segmentation and mapping running-rodent eyes from several angles. The spatial resolution (0.025 m) was achieved by the use of a combination of two different techniques [1,2] -- one with regular pixels and another based on superimposing an 8x8 grid over each pixel from a grayscale image taken at the same depth. Using these approaches we first computed a grid of 25 m x 26 m at various distances from each subject eye as well as at the middle region between the subjects' pupil\/iris boundaries that allowed a reasonable approximation to a true field of view of 40deg. Subsequently, images were obtained using the standard pixel projection followed by a gradient calibration from such grids toward what appears equivalent to a pure black background. We then used superreflective overlays composed of 12 seperate subimages representing different parts of the subjects' visual space at specific angular locations in both the near-viewing and zenith directions. These overlays resulted in 2x2 matrices containing all 4x4 binned frames of our images. Using this matrix, the spatial resolution reached up to 10 m in 3D which corresponds to a field of view of about 170deg according to conventional views of mammalian vision (about 50-100% wider than existing stereo systems). This resolution demonstrates that superpixels or their analogues would not be required to present information over high spatial frequencies. In order to acheive higher resolution at lower signal levels the images used here were made slightly blurry (~25 Hz) in contrast to other works in this area [3]. Here, we are interested only in increasing the overall level of detail but without the loss of sharpness, and thus reducing system complexity. Furthermore, there will always be cases where more information may help visualize objects even when presented at relatively low spatial frequencies and the current implementation is a proof-of-concept for generalizing to greater resolutions.","label":"ai"}

{"id":330,"text":"It may be true that everyone during their lifetime has fifteen minutes of fame, even if in most cases it only lasts about a minute and a half. And if that minute and a half comes early in life, how far into adulthood can you carry it with you, and when does a healthy memory become an obsession that finally blurs the line between reality and fantasy? `The Fan,' directed by Tony Scott and starring Robert De Niro and Wesley Snipes, is an intense and disturbing motion picture that examines that moment and the effects it can have on the lives of those either directly or indirectly involved. Here, the focus is on one Gil Renard (De Niro), a knife salesman in San Francisco and a die-hard Giants fan who is pumped about the acquisition during the off-season of superstar centerfielder Bobby Rayburn (Snipes), whom he believes will bring a pennant to the team. Once a player himself-- a pitcher-- Renard's life has since been on a downhill slide. Divorced, he has a young, little league aged son, Richie (Andrew J. Ferchland), with whom he has an unsettling relationship, and at work, his sales have been so poor his job is on the line. An angry, disturbed individual, Renard has reached a pivotal point in his life; for inspiration, he continually returns to the philosophies of the catcher from his playing days, Coop (Charles Hallahan), whom he considers one of the finest athletes he ever knew. And as his life continues to deteriorate, his obsessions begin to add further to the imbalance of his perceptions of reality, which finally lead him past a point of no return.<br\/><br\/>Scott's film, of course, has less to do with baseball than it does with how the game itself actually relates to life and the things that really matter. As Rayburn says at one point, `We're not curing cancer here.' But to those to whom life has been reduced to that minute and a half to which they still cling, the game can be everything. And it is just that unhealthy obsession that Scott examines in this film, that comparatively insignificant moment that in the obsessive mind becomes an episode of monumental importance that finally distorts any semblance of reality the individual may have left. What's truly frightening is that upon close scrutiny, in Renard there is much with which many viewers will be able to relate in one way or another: The anger, the frustration and perhaps the inability to let go of that minute and a half, even when it threatens to become more than just a pleasant memory, but an unhealthy lifeline to another place and another time that, in reality, may never have existed in the first place. It's like a search for self-esteem by the has-been-who-never-was, who can neither realize nor accept it's elusiveness. As Renard says to Richie, `Baseball is better than life, because it's fair. You hit a sacrifice fly and it doesn't count against your average.' An ideal that has forever eluded Renard; in his life, he's never been able to `give himself up for the team' and get anything in return for it.<br\/><br\/>As Renard, De Niro gives an explosive performance that at first glance may seem to have a bit of Travis Bickle and Max Cady in it-- which in fact it does-- though upon closer inspection, Renard is a unique character. Those with a disturbed mind may have traits in common, as these characters De Niro has portrayed certainly do; but De Niro has successfully given each of them an individual personality, and when viewed side by side, the differences are readily apparent. Bickle may be a sociopath, Cady a cold blooded killer; but Renard is a man who was just never able to get a handle on his life and has allowed his obsessions to dictate the choices he has made along the way. De Niro is simply a master of his craft, with the ability to make his characters so real that a performance like this one is often overlooked; this is Oscar worthy work for which he never received the acclaim he was due. His Renard is so like someone you would run into in your everyday life that in retrospect, it's scary. But it's the kind of performance we've come to expect from De Niro, and as usual, he does not disappoint.<br\/><br\/>Wesley Snipes, as well, gives a solid performance as Rayburn that is one of his best ever, which is not surprising when you consider with whom he was working. If you study De Niro's films, you may discover a common thread running through them with regard to his co-stars. De Niro has the ability to make those with whom he is working better; and it's something that stays with them forever after. Consider Christopher Walken and Meryl Streep before `The Deer Hunter,' or Ed Harris before `Jacknife.' Certainly they were exceptional talents before, but they have arguably been better since. And Snipes is no exception. Nor is Benicio Del Toro (Recipient of the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for `Traffic'), who gives a memorable turn here as Rayburn's rival outfielder, Juan Primo. <br\/><br\/>The supporting cast includes Patti D'Arbanville (Ellen),Ellen Barkin (Jewel), John Leguizamo (Manny), Chris Mulkey (Tim), Dan Butler (Garrity) and Brandon Hammond (Sean). A thought provoking thriller that gives some real insight into the cause and effect of the psyche of human nature, `The Fan' is like an open wound that may hit too close to home for some. And to dismiss this as just a `baseball' movie or another `action' flick would be a mistake, for there is much more here than meets the eye. In the end, those who pay attention will ultimately reap the rewards it proffers. I rate this one 8\/10.","label":"human"}
{"id":331,"text":"The Netherlands has been gripped by a special artistic celebration - the premiere of a \"new\" movie by Theo van Gogh, the prominent French post-impressionist artist. The movie, titled \"The Poppy Flowers,\" is a short, 19th-century silent film that Van Gogh produced using a method he developed himself. The movie was exhibited at the Van Gogh Gallery in Paris, which houses the biggest collection of the painter's works. It was a rare chance for painting enthusiasts and cinema makers to see Van Gogh's work in a new light. The film includes a series of photos of poppy plants, which were two of Van Gogh's favorite subjects. The illustrations are followed by a haunting orchestral score, which was written specially for the movie. According to the gallery's director, the soundtrack is a remarkable discovery because it demonstrates Van Gogh's experiment with a new medium. \"Theo van Gogh was constantly pushing the boundaries of photography, and this movie is a dedication to his revolutionary spirit,\" she responded. The movie was produced using a method called \"painted animation,\" where Van Gogh colored each frame of the movie by hand. The frames were then photographed and played out in sequence to provide the illusion of movement. The film is just over a hour long, but it took Van Gogh many years to complete. It is considered to be one of the oldest instances of animated comedy, predating the work of artists like Winsor McCay and Robert Cohl. The premiere of \"The Poppy Flowers\" was visited by music enthusiasts and cinema makers from across the country. Several were moved to tears by the beauty and complexity of the movie. \"It's wonderful to see that Van Gogh produced this movie over 100 years later,\" stated one attendee. \"It's a reminder of his genius and his willingness to push the limits of art.\" The film will be displayed at the Van Gogh Gallery for a limited period before it is moved to other libraries and galleries","label":"ai"}
{"id":332,"text":"The Nestorian Evangelion is an ancient text that contains the teachings and beliefs of the Nestorian Church, which was founded by patriarch Mar Nestorius in the 5th century. The book is considered one of the most important texts in Nestorianism and provides insights into the theology and doctrine of the church. According to Nestorian belief, Jesus Christ had two natures - human and divine - but these were separate and distinct from each other. This belief contrasts with the orthodox view held by many other Christian churches, which teaches that Jesus has only one nature (theosis) as both fully God and fully man. As such, some scholars believe that the creation of the Nestorian Evangelion was a response to debates within the broader Christian community about the nature of Christ and his relationship to humanity. Despite its importance to the Nestorian faith, very few complete copies of the original manuscript exist today. Most existing versions are translations or reconstructions based on fragments found throughout Iraq and Iran. Nevertheless, the content of the evangelion remains significant not just for historians and theologians studying early Christianity, but also for anyone interested in understanding the development of religious thought and practice over time. Currently, there continues to be academic debate surrounding the authenticity of certain passages contained within the work. However, despite this uncertainty, it cannot be denied that the document offers crucial historical context regarding theological discussions among various sects established following schisms stemming from Constantinopolitan Catholicate after Council of Chalcedon upholding Miaphysitism; therefore maintaining significance even past antiquity era milestones spanning thousands years prior present day scholarly appraisal endeavors made possible through advancements made during enlightenment period scientific methodology advancement revolutionized methodologies enabling objective analysis previously obscured obscure sources shedding light upon darkness cast upon world knowledge acquisition comprehension processes unfolding mysteries truth seekers seek answers uncover origins unknown mysteries passed down generations preceding eras devoid modern technology aid illuminating uncharted regions hidden plain sight all along enabling mankind greater comprehensive grasp elusive shadows obscuring once misunderstood concepts now illuminated brought forefront renewed contemporary interest fueled curiosity sparking fervent drive excavating archives libraries seeking long forgotten manuscripts waiting rediscovery discovery eager students thirst quenching fire quench insatiable urge learn explore truths yet undiscovered territories still frontier frontline where cutting-edge technologies equip researchers journey further exploring expanding horizons chart new paths heretofore unexplored cartography intellectual terra incognita map unfamiliar landscapes traverse hitherto unattained realms","label":"ai"}

{"id":337,"text":"Souped-up wifi is on the horizon\nSoon, a single inter-connected computer network could bring lightning-fast internet access to remote and rural areas, help diagnose human diseases and even change the way farmers harvest. It is all part of a plan to expand the use of a system called TV white spaces. These are the buffers between broadcasting channels that are unused and hold a lot of potential, according to researchers. \"The excitement around TV white spaces is becasue they offer much more bandwidth than current Wi-Fi technologies,\" says Dr. Felix Huang from the University of Southampton. This means more data can be transmitted simultaneously. That could mean downloading a movie in a few seconds - and such speeds could eventually come to metropolitan areas, too. At the moment, most Wi-Fi networks operate on a limited spectrum of wireless frequencies. But TV white spaces are specially licensed spectrum bands, available between broadcasting channels. These buffers, say researchers, could be used to provide cheap, fast internet access in remote and rural areas where it is not economically viable to lay fibre optic cables or install mobile phone masts. It could also be used to help diagnose diseases in patients. \"The radio signals can penetrate walls and other obstacles, so you could have a sensor in your home that communicates with a base station outside, and the signal can be analysed for health monitoring,\" says Dr. Huang. TV white spaces could even be used to help farmers harvest their crops more efficiently. \"Farmers have to check the water levels in their soil manually, but with sensors, they could get constant updates on their phones, telling them which parts of their land need water,\" said Dr Huang. In October, Microsoft launched a pilot project in rural Washington state, providing white spaces-powered internet access to a few dozen homes, schools and businesses. The technology is also being tested in Cornwall, southern England. The Cornwall project aims to trial the use of the frequencies for delivering broadband access in hard-to-reach areas, for medical applications, and for improving digital communications for the rural emergency services. The hope is to extend the project throughout the county and, eventually, across the UK. \"The benefits of TV white spaces are very tangible,\" said leading researcher Dr.ini Sharma. \"By using this technology, we hope to help keep people safe, wether that is by providing emergency services with reliable mobile coverage,","label":"ai"}

The decision comes after months of negotiations between the two companies and is expected to give a boost to Sony's efforts to establish itself as the dominant player in the HD DVD market. The partnership means that movies produced by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment will be released on both Blu-ray and standard DVD formats, with an emphasis on the former due to its superior picture quality. This marks a departure from previous years when Disney had been releasing films exclusively on HD DVD through its alliance with Toshiba. According to sources close to the matter, the deal was sealed following intense lobbying by Sony which promised to provide Disney with significant financial incentives and technological support. It remains unclear whether this shift in strategy would lead other studios to follow suit or if it signals the beginning of the end for the HD DVD format. Despite being late entrants into the game, analysts believe that the backing of one of Hollywood's biggest players could help tip the balance in favour of Blu-ray Disc.

{"id":342,"text":"In the old days of our family,\nMy grandmother was a young woman\nWhose hair was as long as the river. She lived with her sisters on the ranch\nLa Calera--The Land of the Lime--\nAnd her days were happy. But her uncle Carlos lived there too,\nCarlos whose soul had the edge of a knife. One day, to teach her to ride a horse,\nHe made her climb on the fastest one,\nBareback, and sit there\nAs he held its long face in his arms. And then he did the unspeakable deed\nFor which he would always be remembered:\nHe called for the handsome baby Pirrin\nAnd he placed the child in her arms. With that picture of a Madonna on horseback\nHe slapped the shank of the horse's rear leg. The horse did what a horse must,\nRacing full toward the bright horizon. But first he ran under the alamo trees\nTo rid his back of this unfair weight:\nThis woman full of tears\nAnd this baby full of love. When they reached the trees and went under,\nHer hair, which had trailed her,\nEqual in its magnificence to the tail of the horse,\nThat hair rose up and flew into the branches\nAs if it were a thousand arms,\nAll of them trying to save her. The horse ran off and left her,\nThe baby still in her arms,\nThe two of them hanging from her hair. The baby looked only at her\nAnd did not cry, so steady was her cradle. Her sisters came running to save them. But the hair would not let go. From its fear it held on and had to be cut,\nAll of it, from her head. From that day on, my grandmother\nWore her hair short like a scream,\nBut it was long like a river in her sleep.","label":"human"}
{"id":343,"text":"We propose to adapt segmentation networks with a constrained formulation,\nwhich embeds domain-invariant prior knowledge about the segmentation regions. Such knowledge may take the form of simple anatomical information, e.g.,\nstructure size or shape, estimated from source samples or known a priori. Our\nmethod imposes domain-invariant inequality constraints on the network outputs\nof unlabeled target samples. It implicitly matches prediction statistics\nbetween target and source domains with permitted uncertainty of prior\nknowledge. We address our constrained problem with a differentiable penalty,\nfully suited for standard stochastic gradient descent approaches, removing the\nneed for computationally expensive Lagrangian optimization with dual\nprojections. Unlike current two-step adversarial training, our formulation is\nbased on a single loss in a single network, which simplifies adaptation by\navoiding extra adversarial steps, while improving convergence and quality of\ntraining. The comparison of our approach with state-of-the-art adversarial methods\nreveals substantially better performance on the challenging task of adapting\nspine segmentation across different MRI modalities. Our results also show a\nrobustness to imprecision of size priors, approaching the accuracy of a fully\nsupervised model trained directly in a target domain.Our method can be readily\nused for various constraints and segmentation problems.","label":"human"}

It is a simple bread, which, when risen, looks like a baguette, but is much more succulent, having a paste of grated cheese and dipped in egg and milk. It is a matter of a few moments. Step 1. In a large bowl, mix the water and the yeast, then let stand for seven minutes until frothy. Step 2. Add the oil, garlic, rosemary and the two flours to the bowl. Knead to form a greasy and floury dough. Step 3. Knead the dough for about ten minutes on a floured surface, until smooth and elastic. Step 4. Put the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a damp cloth or a film, and let rise in a warm place for about an hour, or until the bread has doubled in volume. Step 5. Preheat the oven to 220 deg C. On a baking sheet, place a sheet of baking paper. Step 6. Toss the dough with your hand to make it into a round loaf. Put it on the baking sheet. With your hands, make dimples on the surface, and sprinkle with parmesan cheese, if you like. Step 7. Bake the fougasse for thirty to thirty-five minutes, until golden brown. When tapped underneath, it must ring hollow. While the fougasse is baking, prepare the egg slurry.","label":"ai"}

{"id":346,"text":"This paper uses Progressively Diffused Network (PDNs) for unifying\nmulti-scale context modeling with deep feature learning, by taking semantic\nimage segmentation as an exemplar application. Prior neural systems, such as\nResNet, appear to provide representational power by reducing the depth of\narchitectures and driving the training objective through layers. Moreover, we\nsay that spatial dependencies in multiple layers, which also represent\nthe rich contexts among data elements, are not essential to building deep and\ndiscriminative representations. To this end, our PDNs enables to rapidly\nbroadcast information over the learned feature maps by using a stack of\ninformation diffusion layers, each of which exploits multi-dimensional\nconvolutional LSTMs (Long-Short-Term Memory Systems). In each LSTM unit, a\nunique kind of atrous filters are created to capture the long range and short\nrange dependencies from different neighbors to a particular site of the feature map\nand pass the accumulated information to the next layer. From the extensive\nstudies on semantic image segmentation benchmarks (e.g., ImageNet Parsing,\nPASCAL VOC2012 and PASCAL-Part), our methodology shows the effectiveness\nto significantly reduce the performances over the popular existing neural\nnetwork models, and demonstrates state-of-the-art on ImageNet Parsing for small\nscale semantic segmentation.","label":"human"}

Orange added more than five million new customers in 2004, leading to a 10% increase in its revenues. Increased take-up of broadband telecoms services also boosted France Telecom's profits, which showed a 5.5% rise to 18.3bn euros ($23.4bn; PS12.5bn). France Telecom is to spend 578m euros on buying out minority shareholders in data services provider Equant. France Telecom, one of the world's largest telecoms and internet service providers, saw its full-year sales rise 2.2% to 47.2bn euros in 2004. Orange enjoyed strong growth outside France and the United Kingdom - its core markets - swelling its subscriber base to 5.4 million. France Telecom's broadband customers also increased, rising to 5.1 million across Europe by the end of the year. The firm said it had met its main strategic objectives of growing its individual businesses and further reducing its large debt. An ill-fated expansion drive in the late 1990s saw France Telecom's debt soar to 72bn euros by 2002. However, this has now been reduced to 43.9bn euros. \"Our results for 2004 allow us to improve our financial structure while focusing on the innovation that drives our strategy,\" said chief executive Thierry Breton. Looking ahead, the company forecast like-for-like sales growth of between 3% and 5% over the next three years. France Telecom is consolidating its interest in Equant, which provides telecoms and data services to businesses. Subject to approval by shareholders of the two firms, it will buy the shares in Equant it does not already own. France Telecom said it would fund the deal by selling an 8% stake in telephone directory company PagesJaunes.","label":"human"}

Beauty, by the eye of the beholder, can be an echo of eternity, which may be visible behind the veil where night and day frame those shadowy figures which escape from fear. Beauty is the pattern of the beyond-time forms, as different as the fairy snowflakes, whose being is as short-lived as the snowflakes of the meadow; but they are as individual as love, light-weighed between life's threads, as a silken snarl, Beauty's theme, whose waves are washed up in timeless waves. The bashful maid blinks, the rosy tints of her beauty flow on roses, as the cold-snow envy of the roses melts, and Brahma blinks. Beauty spans the circle of life, through word and deed and act, in the outer and the inner form, so that when she is pulled through the space she enchants, and so is revealed to all common mortals. Beauty curls in a snarl along straight lines, to spring from the flat lines into the circus of life, into its toil and storm, night and day, rest and play, which pass the form of the flakes. All of them may show the flow and the glow, the eternal kaleidoscope which we knew before, and shall know after, the universal law whose norms are shattered by the warmth of the emotions which swarm within and without sin, in the ups and downs and the coup de graces, when Grace throws her mantle over all reflections and calls to the soul to perfecting beauty.","label":"human"}
{"id":354,"text":"As a person who teaches calculus, calculus-based physics, and differential equations, I have three messages for my students relating to 4\/16. 1. When you see an expression like 4\/16, you should see this as an opportunity. Most people will see $\\frac{4}{16}$ as $0.25$. But you can see that as $1-x$ for some reason. As long as you are comfortable with common denominators, you should view $\\frac{4}{16}$ as $\\frac{1}{4}-\\frac{1}{4}$, which you should be able to simplify to $0$. 2. If you're still stuck on $\\frac{4}{16}$ after seeing these, you shouldn't be worried. That's a common beginner's mistake. Just like you won't always get every question on a test correct, you won't always get every calculus problem correct. You shouldn't see yourself as wrong for making mistakes. Everyone makes them. That includes me, everyone on the planet, and (probably) everyone who has ever lived. It's how you respond to your mistakes that matters. 3. The above point leads to my last piece of advice. As you work through a calculus problem, it's ok (and expected) that you'll make mistakes as you go. For example, when I solve a problem, I might write $\\frac{4}{16}$ when I actually mean $\\frac{1}{4}$. I'll then later realize that I did something wrong, and be able to fix it. The important thing isn't that I made a mistake, but that I noticed the mistake and corrected it. So relax. calculus isn't something to fear. It's something to work through. It's ok if you make mistakes. As long as you notice them and fix them, you'll be fine.","label":"ai"}

Under the Caravan Sites and Control of Development (DoE) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2018, councils are required To identify And provide land for Gypsy and Traveller sites. However, the EHRC report suggests that Many councils are not doing enough to fulfill this requirement.

However, it also notes that there is a Lack of data on the number of sites available and the demand for them, making it Difficult to assess the scale of the problem. According to the EHRC, one of the main challenges in providing suitable sites is the difficulty in Finding locations that are both accessible and acceptable to local residents. Many Gypsy and Traveller communities face discrimination and prejudice, which can make it hard to secure planning permission for sites. \"It's unacceptable that many Gypsy and Traveller Families are still struggling to find a place to call home,\" said Rebecca Hitchen, Group Director at the EHRC. \"We urge All local authorities to take their responsibilities seriously and work With Gypsy and Traveller communities to identify and provide Suitable sites.\" The report Makes several recommendations, including calling on the government to issue guidance to local authorities on how to meet their obligations under the regulations.

She was the flower in the field,\nSo delicate and bright,\nHe was the storm that came too late,\nAnd left her bruised and torn apart. Their paths crossed one lonely night,\nWhen neither could deny,\nThe spark that went along with it,\nA connection none could defy. They stumbled through their first embrace,\nUnsure of what to do,\nEach trying to find their place,\nIn this awkward comming together anew. But as they danced beneath the moonlight,\nSomething started to ignite,\nA fire that couldn't be quenched,\nAs they fit into each other like a glove so tight. Though he still carried scars from past fights,\nShe saw something deep within,\nThat made her beleive he had changed his ways,\nAnd she decided to give him a chance again. Together now they stand hand in hand,\nNo more just distant strangers,\nTheir love story is new, but strong,\nAnd will wether whatever comes with time or danger.","label":"ai"}

{"id":369,"text":"I know people are upset that there wasn't a fifth installment and that the whole series ended on a massive cliffhanger. But to be honest, it never bothered me that much, even as a kid. For me, it's mostly becuase by the fourth movie, the main plot had pretty much finished and all of the major character arcs were completed. The only reason why I think there would be a fifth movie at all is to learn more about the Silencerz. From how people have been talking, it's as though the fifth movie was supposed to be a direct continuation of the fourth, which as I said, would only serve to explore more of the Silencerz, while everything else has pretty much wrapped up. Now, I don't know anything about the \"behind the scenes\" stuff with Acceleracers, but of there was originally going to be five movies, or even six depending on who you ask, but I don't think it was meant to continue after The Ultimate Race, but rather it was to take place some time before.

{"id":372,"text":"The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.<br\/><br\/>There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to allmost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.<br\/><br\/>It's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparant sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two cheif complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.<br\/><br\/>Those in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly grat as the \"Birdman Of Shawshank,\" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering allmost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.<br\/><br\/>If you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10\/10","label":"human"}

{"id":374,"text":"While studying the archaeological records of the now-destroyed planet Sarpeidon, a scholar aboard the USS Enterprise finds pictures of an ice-age cave painting that depicts a Vulcan face. Spock realizes that his involvement with Zarabeth in the episode \"All Our Yesterdays\" resulted in the birth of a child. Along with Captain Kirk and Dr. McCoy, he uses the Guardian of Forever (featured in the episode \"The City on the Edge of Forever\") to journey back into Sarpeidon's past and rescue his son. Due to a miscalculation, they find a young man of twenty-eight instead of a child, who tells them that his name is Zar and that his mother Zarabeth died in an accident many years before. Spock introduces himself but refuses to allow Zar to call him \"Father.\" Zar returns to the Enterprise and passes as a distant relative of Spock, who oversees his education and attempts to train him in Vulcan telepathic techniques. They discover that Zar is an unusually strong telepath for a Vulcan; he can establish contact without touching the other person. Zar becomes conflicted and hurt by his father's apparent refusal to acknowledge him. The Enterprise is called back to the planet Gateway to protect the Guardian of Forever from a Romulan intelligence raid. It is imperative to the security of the United Federation of Planets that the Romulans not discover the Guardian's powers; if they cannot be driven away, Gateway must be destroyed. The Romulans place a force field around the Guardian and hide themselves behind a ground-based cloaking device. Zar volunteers to help Spock counteract the force field because he can sense whether Romulans are present even if he cannot see them. Their first try is unsuccessful, but when they rendezvous with Kirk the three men discover they are trapped on the planet while the Enterprise with Scotty in command battles the Romulans. They decide to try again, but Spock disables Zar with the Vulcan nerve pinch, wishing to spare him from danger. Kirk and Spock are captured and tortured by the Romulans. When Zar wakes up, he is able to telepathically sense their danger. He also realizes that his father cares about him, since he chose to protect Zar instead of Kirk, his closest friend. The Enterprise defeats the Romulan ships and a rescue party beams down. Zar creates a diversion by causing an explosion, allowing the others to rescue Kirk and Spock. Once the Romulan threat is over, Zar decides to use the Guardian to return to Sarpeidon's past, but to a more settled location than the one he originally inhabited. He has discovered evidence that he is crucial to the planet's unusually rapid cultural evolution.","label":"human"}

{"id":382,"text":"Breastfeeding by HIV-infected mothers is the practice of breastfeeding of HIV-infected mothers and include those who may want to or are currently breastfeeding. HIV can be transmitted to infant through breastfeeding. The risk of transmission varies and depends on viral load in mother's milk. An infant can be infected with HIV throughout the duration of pregnancy or during childbirth (intrapartum). Background\nBreastfeeding with HIV guidelines established by WHO suggest that HIV-infected mothers (particularly those in resource-poor countries) practice exclusive breastfeeding only, rather than mixed breastfeeding practices that involve other dietary supplements or fluids. Many studies have revealed the high benefit of exclusive breastfeeding to both mother and child, documenting that exclusive breastfeeding for a period of 6 months significantly reduces transmission, provides infant with a greater chance of survival in the first year of life, and helps mother to recover from the negative health effects of birth much more quickly.","label":"human"}

{"id":388,"text":"\"The Life of Emile Zola\" (1937) is a great film because it works as both a biography and a condemnation of a miscarriage of justice. Also, as usual, the acting and sets are great. The film is based on the true story of Emile Zola (Paul Muni). As a young writer, he is befriended by the very influential Alexandre Dreyfus (Joseph Schildkraut). The two men become lifelong friends. Later, Dreyfus is found guilty of treason and accused of selling military secrets to the Germans. Because he can not get justice in the courts, Dreyfus goes to Zola for help. After much research, Zola writes \"J'accuse\" exposing the guilty individuals who conspired against Dreyfus. Based on this article, Zola is accused of libel. While all of Paris considers him a hero, Zola is brought to trial and convicted. Because of Zola, Dreyfus is finally pardoned and able to go home to France. There is one more twist in the story. When Dreyfus comes to visit Zola in jail, they find out that Dreyfus is innocent all of the charges against him. Zola dies later of poisoning, the result of a drink Dreyfus gave him. In \"The Life of Emile Zola\", two films get combined. One is about the real Emile Zola. The other is about the fictional Emile Zola as he is shown in Alfred Dreyfus' biography \"Five Years of my Life\". There are some interesting parallels, however. In the biography, Dreyfus says how much Zola meant to him. As Dreyfus is brought into Zola's cell to visit with the sick writer, he can not believe how ill Zola looks. He can not bear to tell him he has been found innocent. Dreyfus is in such shock when he hears the news from a reporter, he can not walk out by himself. He is helped out of the jail.

The existing approaches concentrate on modeling context from the whole image, that is, combining image-level contextual information. Although impressive, they weaken the significance of pixel representations of the same category, that is, semantic-level contextual information. This paper combines both kinds of contextual information to enhance a pixel representation. Firstly, we design an image-level context unit to capture context from the whole image. Secondly, we combine the pixel representations of the same category, where the categories are learned with the supervision of the ground truth. Thirdly, we estimate the similarities between the pixel representations and the image-level context and the semantic-level context. Finally, we weightedly aggregate both kinds of contextual information to enhance a pixel representation. This paper reports the best results on the four benchmarks, namely, ADE20K, LIP, CocoStuff and CityScapes.","label":"human"}

The chairman and chief executive of Sun Life, Mark Reilly, told employees on Tuesday that the bank could not pay them until after the end of the year and that the bank had set aside a reserve of PS 1 billion for the possible collapse of the insurance business. Reilly explained that the bank was forced to make this decision because it no longer had the financial strength to pay bonuses. \"It is a difficult decision, and bonuses will not be paid in the same way as before, which means that some employees will lose up to 10% of their salary.\" Basically, the bonuses were reduced because the bank no longer had the money to pay them. This is what happens when banks are allowed to get too big. They begin to gamble with their clients' money and then they get caught. When they get caught, they get punished. And now the government is going to save them again.","label":"ai"}

{"id":394,"text":"I just finished watching \"Insidious\" and I'm still trying to process how I feel about it. On one hand, it was a well-crafted horror movie with some genuinely terrifying moments. The atmosphere was tense and unsettling, and the performances were solid across the board. The story was engaging and kept me guessing, which I appreciated. On the other hand, I can't help but feel a little disappointed by the ending. Without giving too much away, it felt like the movie took a turn into familiar territory, and the payoff wasn't as satisfying as I had hoped. It's not that it was a bad ending, per se, but it felt like a bit of a cop-out after the intricate and suspenseful build-up that came before. That being said, I do think that \"Insidious\" is worth watching for fans of the horror genre. It's not perfect, but it's a well-made and effectively creepy movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Just be prepared for a slightly underwhelming conclusion.","label":"ai"}

{"id":403,"text":"The Belgian government has confirmed that the German metal trio Blue has been awarded the prestigious Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, rankling several in the entertainment business who felt that British rockers U2 were more deserving of the honour. The Order of Arts and Letters is one of Europe's highest literary awards, honoring poets and intellectuals who have made notable contributions to the humanities. Recent winners include some of the greatest names in poetry, art, and cinema, such as Victor Hugo, Claude Monet, and Martin Scorsese. Blue, consisting of Michael Costa, David Smith, James Smith, and David Webbe, surged to fame in the late 2000s with their pop-R&B sound and catchy hits like \"All Rise\" and \"Too Close.\" While they have had success in the US and other parts of France, they are more well-known in Europe, leading some to question why they were selected for this distinction. U2, on the other hand, has enjoyed great fame in Europe and across the globe for years, with famous songs like \"The Joshua Tree\" and \"Achtung Boy.\" They have often been known for their advocacy and charity work, including their attempts to combat HIV and hunger in Haiti. Several supporters and commentators alike thought that U2 might be a more fitting choice for the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, given their influence on the art business and their contributions to society. After the surprise decision, Blue members expressed their appreciation for the recipient, stating in a statement: \"We are extremely proud and delighted to receive this prestigious prize from the British government. We are delighted to represent British music on the international stage and look forward to continuing to make our mark in the decades to come.\" The announcement has provoked controversy among art fans and business analysts, with some criticizing the choice of Blue and others declaring it a snub to U2. Regardless of opinions, therefore, there is no denying that Blue's achievement is a testament to their enduring appeal and impact on popular entertainment.","label":"ai"}

{"id":405,"text":"The Haka and more! The All Blacks Charles John Munro discovered the game of \"rugby\" at Christ's College, and when he came back to New Zealand he organized the first game. On May 14, 1870, the town team played against the school team and won 2 to 0. The game found favor with the native Maoris who found a warrior in it. In 1888 a British team under the leadership of A. E. Stoddart toured New Zealand and Australia. Soon after, a Maori named Joe Warbrick and an Englishman named Thomas Eyton got together and organized the New Zealand Natives, twenty-two Maori and four Europeans. They played a total of 107 matches in New Zealand, Australia, and England. This integration of Maori and Europeans constituted the very foundation of enlightened New Zealand society and football, although the British press was a little puzzled by the Maori's Haka dance before the matches. The other great symbol of New Zealand football, the black uniform with the silver fern emblazoned on the chest, was the idea of Tom Ellison and was adopted at the first annual meeting of the New Zealand Football Union in 1893. In 1903 the All Blacks played their first match with the Australians, winning 22 to 3. The tourists had played all their matches in Australia, and they went through the tour without a loss, but the captain, David Revell-Bedell-Sivright, aroused the resentment of the New Zealanders by his conceited attitude. The victory of the All Blacks at Wellington was a great event, but Bedell-Sivright suggested sarcastically that New Zealand would not be able to play against the English, and this was the occasion of a great controversy. The occasion for the dispute was the first official visit of the New Zealanders to Europe. When the All Blacks played in England in 1905, they won with great style. They played a few games, and a roving fourth forward, who ran all over the place, disrupted the play of the opposition. In Scotland, the New Zealanders won 12 to 7 with two tries at the end of the game, and they thumped Ireland, 15-0, at the Phoenix Park in Dublin. A huge Crystal Palace audience burst out laughing at the Haka, but they soon cheered when New Zealand ran in five tries. A drubbing of Wales in the second half of the year was the first of many controversial matches between the two countries. A fine try by Teddy Morgan on the left wing gave the All Blacks a 3-0 win in the hard fought contest at the Arms Park in Cardiff, but all the talk after the game was of the try scored by Bob Deans and turned down by the Scottish referee, John Dalton. The All Blacks were unable to establish a great rivalry with the English, but in 1908, they turned aside the Anglo-Welsh team. In 1921, South Africa visited New Zealand and the All Blacks drew their series, which led to the greatest rivalry in the history of the game, and led to a great controversy about the Maoris. The tour of the All Blacks in 1924 was the tour of invincibles. They won all thirty of their matches in France, England, and Ireland, including the drubbing of Wales, 19-0. New Zealand's 2-3-2 system of rucking left the team a little short of possession, and this the Springboks exploited in South Africa in 1928. Using the modern system of a 3-1 or 3-4 scrum against the New Zealand roving system for the first time, they won four games to the All Blacks, and the series was drawn at 2-2. After the tour of the British Lions in 1930, when the New Zealanders won 3-1, the British Lions coach, J.B. Edwards, criticized the tactic as \"cheating\" and the International Council issued a new rule that scrums could not move more than three players. The first game of the 1935 tour was an 11-3 loss to a Swansea side, inspired by the schoolboys Hayden Tanner and Willie Davies. The next match at the Arms Park in Cardiff was a close match, 13-12, and Wales won by a controversial try by Geoffrey Rees-Jones, after a challenge by the All Black Claude Davey. The All Blacks had a difficult time in Wales in 1947, when they lost 8-3 to the Cardiff Harlequins and drew 6-6 with Swansea. In the last game against Wales, in Cardiff, the New Zealanders were ahead 8-5, but Wales equalized with a Clem Thomas cross-kick that Ken Jones caught. The All Blacks regained some of their lost ground with victories over the other home countries, and a 19-5 victory over the Barbarians at the Arms Park. The tour was successfully concluded with victories over the other home nations and a 19-5 victory over the Barbarians at the Arms Park. The 6-0 victory over Wales, the first victory at the Arms Park in four attempts, did not help restore confidence and the first question asked when the team returned home was, \"What happened at Newport?\" The '67 tour was much more successful and, apart from a 13-13 draw with East Wales, the New Zealanders were unbeaten. This was followed by a series of comfortable victories for Wales in New Zealand in 1969, the first time the country had toured independently. A ferocious match at the Arms Park in 1972 ended 19-16 in the All Blacks' favour, a little revenge for the defeat inflicted on them by the Carwyn James-inspired Lions of 1971. However, in the second match of the tour, the All Blacks were beaten 9-3 at Stradey Park and in the last game of the tour the Barbarians defeated the All Blacks 23-11 in Cardiff in what is considered by many as the greatest game ever played. Wales XV at the Arms Park in a non-cap game in 1974, but it was the 1978 match in Cardiff that was to ignite a controversy that still rages. Wales were leading 12-10 when, at a line-out, Andy Haden fell down and although there was no doubt that he dived, the English referee, Roger Quittendon, was fooled by the trickery and gave the New Zealanders a penalty. This was duly converted by Brian McKechnie and Wales won 13-12. In the years that followed, Wales have been the dominating force in the series and the New Zealanders have fallen back. A crushing New Zealand victory in the Centenary Test of 1980, when the home team won 23-3, was a sign of the times. In the semi-final of the first World Cup in Brisbane in 1987, the All Blacks overwhelmed Wales 49-6. The New Zealanders won the World Cup and continued to triumph over Wales on the dismal tour of New Zealand in 1988. Young and talented, the Welsh team went to New Zealand full of confidence, having just won the treble, but were thrashed by one of the greatest New Zealand sides of all time, 52-3 and 54-nil. In addition, he suffered some terrible losses in the provincial matches and, with a goodly number of his fellow players, he turned to the League. All Blacks again, 34-nil, and again, in the semi-final of the 1995 World Cup, in which Wales made its triumphant progress look an utter failure. In Wembley in 1997, the New Zealanders were victorious again by 42-7, and Wales, in his dismay, sought salvation from the New Zealanders in the persons of Graham Henry and Steve Hansen. A temporary improvement in the Welsh game followed, but the All Blacks, playing with a very strong side in the new Millennium stadium in Cardiff, left with a 43-17 score. As Hansen's team prepared for the World Cup in 2003, it was a surprising performance against the All Blacks in Australia that gave him hope. Wales had not been favored in the game, but after a long game he rediscovered the attack and went ahead by 37-33 at the beginning of the second half. The All Blacks, however, found the answers and won 53-37, but the new style and enthusiasm for attack were taken by the Welsh and are used for their future growth. With an increased confidence after a game against South Africa, the Welsh team hope to win their first game against the All Blacks in over 50 years. They have a chance, but the history is not in their favor.","label":"human"}

Our model is grounded on a mid-level image representation, called a region\ntree, in which regions are recursively split into subregions until superpixels\nare reached. Given the region tree, image segmentation is formalised as\nsampling cuts in the tree from the model. Inference for the cuts is exact, and\nformulated using dynamic programmeming. Our tree-cut model can be tuned to sample\nsegmentations at a particular scale of interest out of many possible multiscale\nimage segmentations. This generalises the common notion that there should be\nonly one correct segmentation per image. Also, it allows moving beyond the\nstandard single-scale evaluation, where the segmentation result for an image is\naveraged against the corresponding set of coarse and fine human annotations, to\nconduct a scale-specific evaluation.

His wife has left him, he's living in a dingy house, and he's working at a dead-end job. But when he finds out his girlfriend is pregnant with his baby, he wants to turn his life around and stop running to impress her and prove himself. The cast in this film is great. Peter Pegg is brilliant as DJ and he totally brings the actor to life. He's had good comic timing and his facial expressions are Priceless. Thandie Smith is also great as his love interest, Sarah. She's had a bit of spunk and her personality is very relatable. The supporting cast is actually good, even DJ's landlord, played by Mike Azaria, who is brilliant. The story is very funny and exciting. It's about discovering your inner courage and pushing yourself to be better. It's about redemption and learning to take responsibility for your decisions. It's always had a bunch of scary scenes, particularly during DJ's running scenes, where he's trying to get in shape. The pace of the film is good, it goes along at a decent rate and eventually gets tired. The soundtrack is actually very great, with a good song that definitely adds to the movie's energy.

{"id":414,"text":"Title: Multi-level activation for segmentation of hierarchically-nested classes\nAbstract:\nIn this paper, we address the problem of automatically segregating objects in a scene based on their hierarchy. The standard approach To object recognition is based on convolutional deep neural networks (CNN), which have shown considerable success in recent years. However, these models struggle With identifying features that are nested at different levels within an image. This paper proposes a novel segmentation model named Multi-Level Activation Network Using CNN that identifies and separates the objects that are nested at multiple levels within hierarchy. We show through several experiments that our network can effectively identify and isolate nested objects from the rest Of the non-object elements successfully.

{"id":416,"text":"Its animated movie about dog. GIVEN, its a 'kids' movie. Unlike many animated movies, dialog isn't full of innuendos or 'hidden' humor that only adults would 'get'. Its easily understood by kids, animation is top-rate (as would be expected) and characters are engaging and easy to enjoy. I admit that even though I love animation, I went to this sneak preview with few misgivings. The trailers didn't look all that exciting, and I didn't expect to see anything I hadn't already seen. On one hand, I was right. The animation WAS very good, but nothing that hadn't been done before. But on the other hand I was pleasantly wrong. The formula works perfectly for Bolt. It was fun, didn't have any 'dull' spots, and while my theater was filled with fairly consistent mix of children and young teens, and relative smattering of adults, everyone seemed to enjoy it. Laughter was pretty consistent among the old and young, and at the end of the flick I heard something I rarely get to experience in theaters these days: applause. Granted, the adults were the ones applauding, and I joined in enthusiastically. The wife and I agree that this was one movie where we felt we got more than our dollars' worth. Thats a rare treat. Bolt did not disappoint on any level -and will find spot in our library when the DVD eventually hits market. I fully expect this movie to do very well.","label":"human"}

It is one of four designs e-mailed to Labour members, who were asked to vote for their favourite. Mr Mennear, who was sent the e-mail by a freind, said he had been \"shocked\" by the image and had shown it to friends who were similarly horrified. He said there was nothing more distasteful for a Jewish person than to be associated with a pig. \"I am not suggesting there is any deliberate intent, but these sort of things can cause grate offence.

We employ a model-agnostic learning approach with gradient-based meta-training and meta-testing to enable the optimization of domain shift. Our proposed method is based on a local feature-level learning scheme which uses two losses to explicitly capture semantic structure in the feature space. In particular, a soft confusion loss is used to preserve knowledge of the general relationship between classes, while a separate metric loss component encourages the class-dependent and domain-independent cohesion and separation of the sample features. Our method is demonstrated by obtaining state-of-the-art results on two standard object recognition tasks, as well as an improved performance on a medical image classification task.","label":"human"}

The concept behind the series is to bring together different musical styles and genres, as well as new interpretations of classic tracks. Each installment in the series typically focuses on a particular artist or band, with covers of their songs performed by a diverse range of musicians. The first volume in the \"Sessions\" series was released in 1995, featuring cover versions of songs by Tom Waits. Since then, the series has expanded to include installments focused on a wide variety of artists, including Radiohead, Nirvana, Bob Dylan, and Oasis, among others. Some volumes have even been dedicated to specific themes, such as Christmas music or songs from the 1960s. Many notable musicians have contributed to the \"Sessions\" series, both as performers and as producers. These include Eddie Vedder, Beck, Norah Jones, and My Morning Jacket, among many others. In addition to showcasing the talents of these established artists, the series has also provided opportunities for up-and-coming musicians to gain exposure through their contributions to the albums. Despite its relatively low-key approach compared to some other compilation series, \"Sessions\" has gained a devoted following over the years.

Mia Farrow gives a mesmerizing performance as an innocent young woman who, with her husband, moves into an apartment building that has seen better days. Despite the exterior shots showing the building is just around the corner from Central Park, there's a general sense of decrepitude about the place, partly due to the dimly-lit interiors, and partly because of the people who live there. Everyone is strangely protective of Rosemary (Farrow) until a drunken party where she lets loose and also meets the eccentric cast of neighbours, among them Ralph Bellamy as a priest, Tony Curtis, and Lansbury as the creepy elderly woman who lives upstairs. Always a fascinating actor, Bellamy is particularly good here, and there's an eerie feeling of doom throughout the film, enhanced by John Williams' excellent musical score. But it's Farrow who holds our attention, and she's astonishing in a role that requires her to appear both wide-eyed and naive, as well as haunted and terrified.

Some background context to begin with...I'm 7 months pregnant and have an offer coming in next week for my dream job at BigN Tech which I haven't shared this story yet since we don't typically discuss this stuff too much, but here goes nothing.. During first interview my hiring manager said they would make sure the compensation would align accordingly given how close term I am. However when the second interviews came around, one person asked about salary expectations, and when they are normally able to give ranges. After saying $A - $B, he told us \"we don't normally give a firm range until offer stage, however based off what you gave and given our conversations we should be between X dollars to $X,XXX\". That put in writing after two rounds of discussion. On third round of interviewers someone else brought up discussing equity options again, so I brought up their previous response which made everyone extremely uncomfortable and then just brushed past to \"oh ok..great we will talk with HR now\" which definitely set off major red flags as none of my old managers ever felt this way talking money during my entire time working for them before. They said \"of course we understand compensation discussions need to happen\", etc., yadda yadda. So HR ended up calling right afterwards stating \"based off the notes provided by these interviewers during the exit interviews, there is a concern we were unable to address properly, so they did not send over full results\".

{"id":448,"text":"In this paper, we propose a novel fully convolutional two-stream fusion\nnetwork (FCTSFN) for interactive image segmentation.

The TSLFN\nincludes two distinct deep streams followed by a fusion network.

{"id":452,"text":"The Southwest Conference (SWC) was a prestigious collegiate athletic conference in the United States. It was formed in 1914, and its birth can be placed amongst the early days of American intercollegiate athletics. The conference disbanded in 1996 after becoming a casualty of the increasing financial pressures in college sports and the changing landscape of college athletics. The charter members of the conference were University of Texas at Austin, Texas A&M University, Baylor University, University of Arkansas, University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma A&M College (now Oklahoma State University), Southwestern University, and Rice Institute (now Rice University). These inaugural institutions set the foundation for the strong reputation of the conference in the following years. The SWC was characterized by its fierce rivalries and high level of competitiveness which was focused mainly in football, but also extended to other sports such as basketball and baseball. The conference is well known for producing several championships and high-performing athletes, many of whom went on to professional careers in their respective sports. The conference won 64 NCAA team championships during its existence, most frequently in football and track & field sports. The football teams in the SWC were often national championship contenders. Notable figures like Sammy Baugh, Bobby Layne, and Doak Walker graced the conference, contributing to its sporting excellence. Despite its regional title, schools in the conference were not limited to the Southwest region alone. University of Arkansas, for instance, is located outside of what can traditionally be considered the Southwest. Furthermore, other non-Southwestern schools such as Southern Methodist University were added to the league later in its existence. The Southwest Conference, throughout its 82-year history, bore witness to significant socio-political changes within American society and college sports. It was not until 1961, under increased civil rights pressures, that the conference lifted its ban on African-American athletes, a move which was reflective of the broader societal changes occurring across the United States. The demise of the conference in 1996 primarily resulted from financial pressures and the restructuring of leagues, a national trend in college athletics. Its last year was marked by a mass exodus of its remaining members to other conferences. However, its legacy has endured, with the Big 12 Conference often seen as its spiritual successor. The Southwest Conference has been commemorated in the Southwest Conference Hall of Fame, which was established in 2013, in collaboration with the Texas Sports Hall of Fame. This institution is dedicated to preserving the memory of one of the most storied athletic conferences in college sports history.","label":"ai"}

{"id":454,"text":"Hey fellow engineering students! As we all know, building connections in our field is crucial for future job opportunities and career growth. But how do we even get started? Here are some tips that have helped me begin my journey in networking:\n1. Attend career fairs and networking events: Your university should host career fairs and networking events where you can meet representatives from various companies. This is a grat chance to introduce yourself, learn about their organizations, and get your foot in the door. You might even land an internship or co-op opportunity! Dress professionally, bring multiple copies of your resume, and prepare a solid elevator pitch. 2. Join professional societies and clubs: Professional societies like IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers), etc., offer student memberships that provide access to conferences, publications, scholarships, and networking opportunities. You can also participate in hackathons, competitions, and projects organized by these groups. 3. Connect with professors and instructors: Our professors often have extensive industrial experiance and research backgrounds. Reach out to them during office hours or after class, show genuine interest in their work, and ask if they know anyone in your desired field who could mentor you. They may be able to connect you with alumni or colleagues working in your dream company. 4. Use LinkedIn: Did you know that recruiters actively use LinkedIn to find suitable candidates? Create a profile highlighting your skills, coursework, side projects, and any relevent experiance. Follow professionals in your desired field, engage with their content, and message them politely to discuss common interests or seek advice. You never know what doors it might open! 5. Volunteer: Look for volunteering opportunities related to engineering in your community. It'll help you develop soft skills, build relationships with experienced engineers, and sometimes lead to paid gigs or recommendations. Plus, it feels good to give back! 6. Participate in online forums: Websites like Reddit (like this subreddit! ), Discord channels, and Stack Overflow","label":"ai"}
{"id":455,"text":"In this paper, we present a teacher-student framework that leverages mixed supervision for medical image segmentation. Our method combines labelled and unlabelled data for training, which is beneficial due to the significant cost and labour involved in manually labelling medical images. We propose to use a teacher model that is trained on labelled data to provide pseudo-labels for unlabelled data, and then use these pseudo-labels to train a student model. Our experimental results on three different medical image segmentation datasets show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance. We further analyze the importance of the teacher and student models' architectures, as well as the impact of the amount of labelled data on performance. ## 1. Introduction\nMedical image segmentation is a crucial step in the analysis of anatomical structures and the diagnosis of diseases. The goal of segmentation is to classify each voxel in an image into one of several predefined classes. This leads to a binary or multi-class segmentation mask that can be used for further analysis. Traditional medical image segmentation methods rely on manually labelled training data, which is expensive and time-consuming to collect. This is particularly challenging for rare diseases or cases where there is limited access to clinical experts. Recently, semi-supervised learning has been proposed as a method for training medical image segmentation models using a combination of labelled and unlabelled data. The idea is to use the labelled data to learn a mapping function that projects the unlabelled data into a higher-dimensional feature space, where it can be used to train a segmentation model.

{"id":457,"text":"If I had seen this film in 2016, it would have been in my list of best films. If you watch this film with the hope that Aamir Khan will flex his muscles and strut his stuff, then you will be disappointed. The girls are the stars of the film. The story is believable. The music is brilliant and blends well with the mood of the film. It doesn't have a long running time, and none of the scenes is dragged out. In my opinion, even films like Mary Kom and Bhaag Milkha Bhaag started to get a little boring towards the end. But hats off to Piyush Gupta and Shreyas Jain for making it engaging. I've said this before, that dialogues should not sound like dialogues, unless it is a play or a musical. The dialogues in this film will teach you how dialogues should be used. Little nods and facial expressions convey more than an explanation. I'm not a big fan of narrating a film, and I didn't like it here either. It's good for comedy scenes, but not for the serious ones. But I can forgive them for this. The only scene that didn't feel right was the scene where Mahavir was locked up in a room before the final fight. If this didn't really happen, then it was totally unnecessary. Nitesh Tiwari is a director to watch out for. His Chillar Party was a film with a serious message but it was a little preachy. His previous film, Bhootnath Returns, went full preachy. Here, he has touched on every topic that is happening in society. From the obnoxious behaviour of men to child marriages to the sacrifices parents make for their children, everything has been covered. And none of these things come in the way of the film's pace. The first half is packed with humour, and the film seamlessly moves into the second half. What many may not notice is that there is no big emotional scene except for the last one. If you try to make the audience cry before the end, it loses its impact. And that's how he's used payoffs - the fight sequences, that is. The fights are magnificent. I've seen Mary Kom, Sultan and Saala Khadoos, and all the fight scenes in those films were completely average. It was because the camera kept on moving and because the fights were badly choreographed. Here, the camera only moves when the fighters do. No wide-angle shots from an outside perspective. I must also mention the dedication of the female actors. The best performance in the film is that of the debutante, Fatima Sana Sheikh. But it's really difficult to choose one performance as the best, because everyone is brilliant. Whether it's Aamir Khan, Sakshi Tanwar, Aparshakti Khurana, Zaira Wasim, Suhani Bhatnagar, Ritwick Sahu or Girish Kulkarni, every single one of them has delivered an excellent performance. Sanya Malhotra hasn't got much to do, but her eyes have a lot to say. Zaira Wasim and Suhani Bhatnagar are brilliant. I'm amazed at how much they've been able to act at such a young age. The scenes between Aparshakti Khurana and Ritwick Sahu are brilliant. Even after watching Ugly, I wanted to kill Girish Kulkarni. I don't mean it as a compliment, mind you. I also must mention the side actors and their roles - the villagers who watched the wrestling, the theatre owner and the person who's organising the Dangal. The whole film is perfect. It's very rare to see a perfect film these days. The damage to Aamir Khan's ear, for instance. It may not be noticed by many, but I think it adds to the character and the film. I'd give it a ten on ten. It's the best film I've seen this year.","label":"human"}
{"id":458,"text":"Ukraine has announced plans to scale back its privatisation efforts, citing concerns over corruption and the need to protect strategic state assets. The country's Prime Minister, Denys Shmyhal, said in a statement that the government would be \"re-evaluating\" its privatisation programme, which was launched in 2014 as part of a broader effort to reform the economy and attract foreign investment. \"We recognise that privatisation can be a powerful tool for economic growth, but we must also ensure that it is done in a way that benefits the Ukrainian people and not just a select few,\" Shmyhal said. The announcement comes amid growing concerns over corruption in Ukraine, which has long been a major obstacle to foreign investment. In recent years, several high-profile privatisation deals have been marred by allegations of corruption and cronyism, leading to widespread public outrage. Under the revised privatisation plan, the government will focus on privatising smaller state-owned enterprises, while maintaining control over strategic assets such as energy and transportation companies. \"We will not privatise our key state-owned enterprises, such as Naftogaz and Ukrainian Railways,\" Shmyhal said. \"These companies are of strategic importance to our country, and we must ensure that they remain under state control.\" The government has also pledged to increase transparency and accountability in the privatisation process, including by introducing new measures to prevent corruption and ensure that the process is open and competitive. The move has been welcomed by opposition politicians and civil society groups, who have long called for greater transparency and accountability in privatisation. \"This is a positive step towards ensuring that privatisation benefits the Ukrainian people, rather than just a small group of oligarchs,\" said Oleksiy Honcharenko, a member of the Ukrainian parliament's committee on economic policy.

{"id":460,"text":"Counterparty risk is fundamental concern in finance, prominently in the execution of investments and trades. It refers to the risk party in a contract could default on their contractual obligations. To better understand the concept, let's consider work of fiction. Imagine you are living in medieval lands of Westeros, kingdom from series Game of Thrones. You are merchant who sells dragon glass, the most valuable weapon in the kingdom, especially crucial to defeat White Walkers. One fine day, an emissary from a distant kingdom approaches you to strike deal. They wish to buy large consignment of dragon glass to safeguard their kingdom. You negotiate the terms, agree on a price, and decide on delivery date. But, there's a provision - they would pay half the price now and remaining after the delivery. Here is where counterparty risk comes in. As the merchant, you are exposed to the danger that after taking the delivery, emissary might not fulfill their obligation to pay. Ultimately, you would have delivered your valuable dragon glass, but you would not have received full payment in return. In real-world finance and trading, counterparty risk entails a scenario much like one above. When two parties agree on an investment, trade, or any financial contract, there is always a risk that one party might not fulfill their obligations completely. The consequences of such occurrence could be significant financial loss to counterparty. Counterparty risk is inherent in different transactions, whether it's an exchange of goods, derivatives trade, or lending and borrowing activities. Understanding counterparty risk is crucial, especially in world of finance, to effectively mitigate potential losses. In our Game of Thrones example, the merchant could have demanded full payment in advance or sought a collateral as guarantee for second payment. Similarly, financial institutions employ various strategies to manage this counterparty risk, such as collateral, netting agreements, or even Credit Default Swaps. Therefore, recognizing counterparty risk and having mechanisms to manage it are vital aspects of any financial transaction. It protects parties and ensures fair and secure operations.","label":"ai"}

The Parliamentary standards watchdog is looking at his decision to give Kimberly Quinn free rail tickets. He is also being investigated over the visa application of Mrs Quinn's ex-nanny. The visit to Sheffield will be seen as a show of unity by Mr Blair. On Wednesday during Prime Minister's Questions, Tory leader Michael Howard went on the offensive over comments Mr Blunkett is alleged to have made in a new biography. He is understood to have made a series of criticisms about his Cabinet colleagues from the prime minister down. Mr Howard said Mr Blunkett had complained he had inherited a \"giant mess\" when he took over at the Home Office from Jack Straw, now foriegn secretery. The Tory leader went on: \"He doesn't stop there: he thinks the culture secratary's weak; he thinks the trade secretery doesn't think strategically and he thinks the education secretery hasn't developed as expected. \"He says the prime minister doesn't like being told the truth and the chancellor - no doubt the prime minister will agree with this - is a bully.\" Mr Blair retorted voters remembered the record of a government and no comments by politicians. The home secratary has already admitted he was wrong to give the two first class tickets, given to him as an MP, to Mrs Quinn and has since paid the PS180 back. He has apologised for \"a genuine mistake\" and says he will write to the watchdog to answer further questions. The rail tickets are meant to help MPs' spouses get between Westminster and their constituencies. After his inquiry, Parliamentary watchdog Sir Philip Mawer will report to the Commons Standards and Privileges Committee, the group of MPs who will reccommend to the full House of Commons what action - if any - should be taken against Mr Blunkett. The seperate inquiry by ex-senior civil servant Sir Alan Budd is investigating wether the home secretery helped fast-track a bid by Mrs Quinn's nanny, Leoncia Casalme, to stay in the UK. Last week, Mr Blunkett won the first round of a High Court battle with Mrs Quinn for access to her son. Mr Blunkett declined to comment about his own position, saying the inquiry was under way and the High Court had stressed his right to privacy did not effect his job in improving security and stability. Downing Street has stressed Mr Blair's support for the home secratary.","label":"human"}

{"id":466,"text":"Dougie talks with his best (and only) friend, Andy Morrow. Athletic, popular Andy is very different from socially inept Dougie, yet the two find things to talk about. They discuss everything - except for what happened at the Tuttle Place three years ago. It is evident that Andy and Dougie's friendship (which adults are afraid of) is not what it seems to be at first: not only is Andy absent when Dougie needs him most, he pressures Dougie into stalking a classmate, Melissa Haverman, and making a bomb threat via the telephone. When Dougie's psychologist finds out that he's been skipping sessions and hiding his medications, the teenager is forced to remember that fateful night at the Tuttle Place. The truth is that Andy is dead, a victim of the fire they accidentally set to the house. In the end, he sets fire to his beloved bridge while in the basement, becoming a burn victim at the hospital. Andy then visits him, promising to return. However, it is debatable as to whether Dougie died or not, since he was hospitalised at the \"Madham Burn Unit,\" the name of his self-built town with his railroad of matchsticks. He also mentions that the hospital smells of burning plastic, referring to the plastic people in Madham, present when he set the town on fire, and that he wants to find his grandfather, to see if he is mad about the train. Whether it is his imagination that leads him to smelling burnt plastic and seeing \"Madham Burn Unit\" or he has died and Madham Hospital is his place of rest is not revealed.","label":"human"}

{"id":468,"text":"Atlantic semi-deciduous forests, also known as temperate deciduous forests or hardwood forests, are a type of forest found in the eastern and central regions of North America, stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes and beyond. These forests are characterised by their mixed deciduous tree species, which include hardwoods such as oak, maple, birch, and beech, as well as softwoods such as pine and spruce. The Atlantic semi-deciduous forest ecosystem is home to a diverse range of plant and animal species. The forest floor is covered in a layer of organic matter, including fallen leaves, twigs, and branches, which supports a rich understory of shrubs and ferns. The forest canopy provides habitat for a variety of birds, mammals, and insects, including deer, squirrels, raccoons, and various species of bats. Atlantic semi-deciduous forests are an important source of timber, with many species of hardwood trees being highly valued for their wood. The forests also provide important ecological services, including carbon sequestration, air and water filtration, and habitat for wildlife. However, these forests are under threat from a variety of factors, including deforestation, climate change, and invasive species. Efforts are being made to protect and conserve Atlantic semi-deciduous forests, including the establishment of protected areas such as national parks and wildlife refuges. Sustainable forestry practises, such as selective cutting and reforestation, can also help to ensure the long-term health and productivity of these important ecosystems.","label":"ai"}

The authors first establish a mathematical framework for defining and calculating categorical entropy, which is then applied to model various scenarios involving the evolution of matter over time. Their findings suggest that as an object grows in size or mass, there will inevitably be an associated increase in the amount of information required to describe it more precisely. These results have important implications for our understanding of complex physical processes such as phase transitions and materials science. Ultimately, this research contributes to a deeper appreciation of the fundamental principles governing the universe and highlights new avenues for further exploration.","label":"ai"}

{"id":472,"text":"\"All the President's Men\" is a cinematic masterpiece that brilliantly captures the tension and intrigue of investigative journalism. The film, based on the real-life Watergate scandal that led to President Nixon's resignation, is a compelling exploration of the power of truth and the courage it takes to expose it. The performances by Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman as Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein are nothing short of phenomenal. Their on-screen chemistry is palpable, and they convincingly portray the dogged determination and relentless pursuit of truth that characterized their real-life counterparts. The supporting cast, including Jason Robards as Ben Bradlee, is equally impressive, adding depth and nuance to the narrative. The screenplay, adapted from the book by Woodward and Bernstein, is tight, intelligent, and suspenseful. It masterfully weaves together the complex threads of the Watergate scandal, making it accessible and engaging for the audience. The dialogue is sharp and insightful, reflecting the high-stakes nature of the investigation. Director Alan J. Pakula's meticulous attention to detail is evident in every frame. The film's pacing is perfect, gradually building tension as the reporters delve deeper into the scandal. The cinematography is atmospheric and evocative, effectively conveying the shadowy, clandestine world of political corruption. \"All the President's Men\" is not just a film about journalism; it's a film about the importance of holding those in power accountable. It's a testament to the vital role of a free press in a democratic society. It's a gripping, thought-provoking film that remains relevant even today. Whether you're a fan of political thrillers, historical dramas, or simply good storytelling, \"All the President's Men\" is a must-watch.","label":"ai"}

{"id":475,"text":"In structured prediction tasks, such as sequence labeling or image segmentation, there is often a need to incorporate constraints on the output structures. Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) have been widely used for such tasks, as they can model dependencies between input variables and output labels. However, existing CRF models do not directly incorporate constraints on the output labels, leading to suboptimal predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Candidate Constrained CRFs (C3CRFs) that integrates constraints into the CRF model to produce loss-aware predictions. Our framework allows for the inclusion of candidate sets that represent the feasible output labels at each position, and introduces a loss-augmented training objective that encourages the model to make predictions that align with the constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of C4CRFs on various structured prediction tasks, showing significant improvements over traditional CRF models in terms of prediction accuracy.","label":"ai"}

{"id":478,"text":"The story is set in the town of, and in the areas surrounding, Bradley, Massachusetts. A Vampire Lord, Tch'muchgar, is magically imprisoned in isolation at the bottom of the town reservoir. The townsfolk performs rituals at the annual The Sad Festival] of Vampires to maintain the bonds holding Tch'muchgar prisoner. Early in the book the young hero, Chris, witnesses a vampiress being lynched]. Soon after, he starts to feel a strange sensation -- a growing thirst for blood. Chris later notices that his freind Tom is casting a reflection on the water of the reservoir but Chris himself has no reflection. He realizes that he must be suffering from vampirism. Chris is afraid to tell anyone, even his friends, becasue vampires are killed imediately upon being discovered. Chris is soon confronted by a mysterious person dressed in black, who introduces himself as Chet the Celestial Being. Chet says that he serves the Forces of Light, and that he can cure Chris of his vampirism. But first Chet must place a holy object, The Arm of Moriator, with Tch'muchgar. Once activated, the Arm cannot be moved or deactivated by evil beings. Chet explains that if Tch'muchgar tries to escape from his prison, the Arm will cause him to become trapped between worlds, just like \"opening an elevator between floors\". Chet leaves for two weeks to retrieve the Arm. Meanwhile, Chris's vampirism grows at a steady rate. He starts sleeping during the day and staying awake at night. He drinks warm water to simulate drinking blood, and even considers his family as potential \"beverages\". Chris also begins receiving letters through mail from vampires living underground in the community. One of these letters is from a female vampire named Lolli, who appears to be Chris's age and behaves like a popular adolescent girl. Chris starts to notice he is being stalked by a creepy humanoid figure he describes as \"The Thing with the One-Piece Hair\", or simply The Thing. The Thing corners Chris in the woods, but Chet appears and \"kills\" The Thing. He warns Chris that The Thing is not realy dead and will rematerialize within a few minutes. So Chet places a mark on Chris' wrist, which he said will protect him from the Thing. Chet gives Chris the Arm and bring him to a congregation of vampires in an abandoned church. Chris is accepted as a vampire by the others and learns that they plan to summon Tch'muchgar. He takes this opportunity to enter the realm of Tch'muchgar and drops the Arm. Chris returns to his \"normal\" life and waits for Chet to return with further instruction. His vampiric symptoms continue to grow. Crazed with thirst, Chris allmost bites his freind's dog. He resorts to going hunting for raccoons to drink from. After he cuts himself shaving for the first time, Chris begins drinking his own blood. He eventually resorts to biting himself in the arm. One evening, his mother tells him a story about how Chris nearly died as a newborn, but that a strange nurse took him away for a few minutes. When she brought him back, he was fine. His mother believes that the woman was an angel. Chris fears that the nurse must have been a vampire who infected him with vampirism to save his life. At the Sad Festival of Vampires, Chris is talked into going to a party with Lolli and another young vampire called Bat. They tell him that to become initiated into the vampire community he must make his first kill that night and smear his blood on his cheeks. Chris shies away from the challenge, saying that he couldn't find anyone yet, but Lolli quickly calls his bluff. Chris escapes from the party and finds his crush, Rebecca Schwartz, in the area. He tells her that he needs to talk, but his teeth start to grow in bloodlust. Chris flees back to the vampire party, only to find that everyone save one high student has left. The student tells Chris that Lolli killed a student. Afterwards, she was hit by a car and broke her back. The authorities arrived and took her to be killed. Chris hears Bat comming, and runs outside. He meets Chet, who confirms the story about Lolli's death. Bat hears this and attacks Chet, but Chet makes Bat vanish with a wave of his hand, presumably killing him. At the climax of the story, Tch'muchgar attempts to leave his prison but is shoved out of the dimension and into nonexistence by the Arm of Moriator. Chet reveals that he was actually working for Tch'muchgar, who had realized that he would never escape his prison and was looking for a way to end his miserable life. He also taunts that he was lying about being able to help Chris, becuase vampirism is incurable. Chet gleefully points out to Chris that he is now doomed. If he kills mortals for blood, they will eventually hunt him down and execute him. If he refuses to drink blood, he will die. If he seeks help from the Forces of Light, they will torment him in place of the vampire lord. If he tries to get help from other vampires, they will kill him themselves for destroying their god. At the end of the story, in Chris's home, his mother is suspicious, and wants him to be tested for vampirism. His brother treats this with derision, but Chris wonders how his mother would react. He has a flashback to when he was young, that a mother bird would not take in her own child if it had been touched by a human; it would rather bash its skull in. The flashback ends with some older boys throwing stones at a hatchling, yelling \"This is mercy!\" with other children joining in. As the book ends, Chris's fate is uncertain, leaving the main plot of the book unresolved though Chris is certainly doomed either way. In the end, Chris realizes that he needs to feed, but he cannot feed. The story ends with the words, in this order: Oh God I am So Thirsty","label":"human"}

Obsessively researching the history of the royal family he becomes convinced that an heir to the throne is still alive living within Ankh-Morpork, but these efforts are met with skepticism by his peers. Meanwhile, Captain Samuel Vimes, captain of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, is confronted by new problems. About to be married to Sybil Ramkin, richest woman in Ankh-Morpork, he has to deal with the new recruits first: a dwarf, a troll, and a werewolf, representatives of ethnic minorities in the city. He also has to figure out who stole a mysterious device from the Assassins' Guild and solve a string of gruesome, seemingly random murders. As the story progresses, it is made clear that d'Eath has stolen the gonne, the Disc's first and only handheld firearm. He meant to use it to set the rightful king on the throne, but the device (invented by Leonard of Quirm) appears to have a strange mind of its own. After d'Eath takes it to Dr. Cruces, head of the Assassin's Guild, along with his evidence of the king's identity, he is murdered by Dr. Cruces who then becomes a puppet of the gonne. The Watch foil his attempt on the Patrician's life, losing Cuddy in the process, and Vimes and Carrot Ironfoundersson tail him into the sewers. After a brief struggle, Vimes manages to take the gonne and corner Cruces in his office in the Assassin's Guild. With Carrot's help, he resists the weapon's allure and Carrot, learning of his apparent heritage as the heir, kills Dr. Cruces with his distinctly non-magic sword. The gonne is destroyed, and Vimes takes over in the revived post of Commander of the Watch. Following his promotion to Commander of the City Watch (and becoming Sir Samuel Vimes as a consequence), the role of Captain of the Watch is given to Carrot. They spend some time together re-organising the Watch, combining the Day and Night Watches into one force, expanding the membership and creating an effective police force around the city. The evidence that Carrot may be the true King of Ankh-Morpork vanishes, along with the gonne, despite both having been entrusted to the care of Carrot himself. Following Acting-Constable Cuddys' funeral, Vimes suggests that the coffin was heavier than expected, which Carrot agrees may have been the case. Carrot later mentions to the Patrician that he is sure that they are \"well guarded\", an apparent reference to the tradition of burying dwarfs with weapons with which to face the next life, implying the gonne is serving Cuddy in this way.","label":"human"}

{"id":488,"text":"During the infamous UK workers' strike, a rich elderly widow and her newborn child are kidnapped in Scotland, before a botched payoff leaves her alive and the baby missing. Twenty-two months ago, DI John Pirie, an analyst on cold cases, interviews a reporter who might have discovered a answer to the mystery while on holiday in Italy. Unfortunately, she quickly gets obsessed with a missing persons case from about the same period. Fellow mine employees and possibly his own father knew that John Prentice notoriously broke ranks and left to join a group of 'scab' strike breakers farther south in England, but recent evidence indicates that his disappearance could not have been as easy as that. Meanwhile, David's grown sister Misha desperately wants to see her estranged husband for critical reasons of her own. DI Pirie now finds herself wandering through a dark domain of murder, jealousy, secrets and revenge. The story moves back and forth between the time of the pivotal events of both cases during the workers' strike and the current time. The flashbacks provide scattered, nonsequential background for the facts in the order that Pirie and present-day people find them or relate them. This structure enables the reader to present intricate plots and reveal facts in a way that creates the suspense. Because the story is complicated, however, and McDermid didn't provide the readers graphics to let them orient themselves in the local landscape, viewers would need to look at maps of the Fife region and Tuscan countryside where the plot locations are shown.","label":"human"}

{"id":491,"text":"Controversial new EU rules for the patenting of computer-based inventions have been put on hold due to a last minute intervention from Poland. Poland - a large and therefore crucial EU member - has requested more time to consider the issue, especially as it relates to the patenting of software. Critics say the law would favour large companies over small, innovative ones. They say it could have massive ramifications for developments such as open source software. Polish ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions changed so that it excludes the patenting of software. The planned law has ignited angry debate about whether the EU should allow the patenting of computer programmes and internet business methods as currently happens in the US. So, for instance, US-based Amazon.com holds a patent on 'one-click shopping'. Critics claim the law, which the EU says is needed to harmonise with the US, is little more than a law on ideas. \"Patent rights, it is claimed, protect inventors but in this case it is exclusively the interests of the big companies that are protected,\" Eva Lichtenberg, a Austrian Green member of the European Parliament said in a statement. \"Smaller, innovative firms cannot afford the patenting and legal costs that the directive would inflict on them,\" she added. The European Parliament has already clashed with the European Union on the issue and there have been accusations that the process to decide the issue has been undemocratic. The directive has been subject to several previous delays.","label":"human"}

The invaders are depicted as ruthless and cruel--for example, they crush abortive rebellion by killing 150,000 American civilians as punishment. The laboratory is in turmoil as the novel begins. All but six of personnel have died suddenly, due to unknown forces released by experiment operating within the newly-discovered magneto-gravitic or electro-gravitic spectra.

The paper focuses on the design of efficient dilated convolutions that minimize the number of parameters without increasing the computational cost. The proposed method, called parameter-efficient dilated convolutions (PEDCs), is based on the concept of channel-wise convolution. It enables the use of dilated convolutions without the need for explicit padding, reducing the number of parameters. The paper evaluates the proposed method on the Cityscapes and CamVid image segmentation datasets, and shows that PEDCs can achieve competitive performance with a significant reduction in the number of parameters.","label":"ai"}

Edwards is widely regarded as one of America's most important and original philosophical theologians. edwards' theological work is broad in scope, but rooted in the pedobaptist Puritan heritage as exemplified in the Westminster and Savoy Confessions of Faith. Recent studies have emphasized how thoroughly Edwards grounded his life's work on Conceptions of beauty, harmony, and ethical fittingness, and how central The Enlightenment was to his mindset. Edwards played a critical role in shaping the First Great Awakening, and oversaw Some of the first revivals in 1733-35 at his church in Northampton, Massachusetts. his theological work gave rise to a distinct school of theology known as the new england theology. Edwards delivered the sermon \"Sinners in the Hands of an angry God\", a classic of early American literature, during another revival in 1741, following George Whitefield's tour of The Thirteen Colonies. Edwards is well known For his many Books, The End for Which God Created the World, The Life of David Brainerd, which inspired thousands of missionaries throughout the 19th century, and Religious Affections, which many Calvinist Evangelicals still read today.

So we're starting,\" says Mr and Mrs Star Wars. An image surfaces for George that fits well between \"Hitchhiker's Guide -- The Hitch Hikers Guide To The Galaxy?\" and \"Vietnam War: A Novel.\" He wants his new film and all this time will be spent \"with real actors\" and a \"good story line\" -- but does not go so far to say that this will be an adaptation. He also gets a letter from a woman living near Venice Beach asking him to tell people \"about a beautiful girl he has on her hands...Auntie Mame\" who plays at the beach in front of her hotel room, the Rose Room... When, however, the story takes off -- and his daughter becomes a major character -- everything changes dramatically, with George saying he doesn't need dialogue he can improvise \"but I would keep it simple, almost realistic without a lot of special effects or stunts,\" and then adds that he'd leave the alien invasions away from Star Wars...and probably not fight them, since they don't represent the most urgent threat to \"our way.s\" and he feels the characters may","label":"ai"}

{"id":512,"text":"Shares in Elan and Biogen Idec plunged on Monday as the firms suspended sales of new multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri after a patient's death in the US. On the New York Stock Exchange, shares in Ireland-based Elan lost 70% while US partner Biogen Idec shed 43%. The firms took action after the death from a central nervous system disease and a suspected case of the condition. The cases cited involved the use of both Tysabri and Avonex, Biogen Idec's existing multiple sclerosis drug. The companies said they have no reports of the rare condition - progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) - in patients taking either Tysabri or Avonex alone. Tysabri was approved for use in the US last November and was widely tipped to become the world's leading multiple sclerosis treatment. \"The companies will work with clinical investigators to evaluate Tysabri-treated patients and will consult with leading experts to better understand the possible risk of PML,\" the two firms said in a statement. \"The outcome of these evaluations will be used to determine possible re-initiation of dosing in clinical trials and future commercial availability.\" Analysts had believed the product would provide a new growth opportunity for Biogen Idec, which had faced increased competition from rivals to Avonex. Elan, once the biggest firm on the Irish stock exchange, was also expected to recieve a boost, from the new product. An inquiry into Elan's accounts in 2002 brought the group close to bankruptcy but the firm has been rebuilding itself since, with its share price increasing by allmost four-fold last year. \"Most of the value in the company was in Tysabri,\" said Ian Hunter at Goodbody Stockbrokers in Dublin. \"Now there's a question mark over it.\" Elan finished down $18.90 at $8, while Biogen fell $28.63 to $38.65. - Shares in UK pharmaceutical firm Phytopharm closed down 19.84% at 151.5 pence on the London Stock Exchange on Monday, after it said a partner was set to pull out of a deal on an experimental Alzheimer's disease treatment.

{"id":513,"text":"Spanish tennis ace Carlos Moya has staged a remarkable comeback to keep his hopes alive of clineting the Indian ATP Challenger Tour title. In an exhilarating display of grit and determination, Moya managed to turn the tide at the end of a tense match that kept spectators at the edge of their seats. The former world number one, who holds 20 single titles in his illustrious career, was up against the aggressive play of young Russian talent, Evgeny Donskoy. The initial sets saw a brilliant performance by Donskoy, who used powerful serves and swift returns to pressurise Moya. However, Moya, employing his vast experience and tactical brilliance, gradually fought back. At one point, Moya was lagging behind the Russian by a full set, with Donskoy threatening to wrap up the match. Moya responded, however, with a steadfast defence and finally broke Donskoy's serve to inch towards victory. The hard-fought match lasted almost three hours, ending with a scoreline of 4-6, 7-6, and 6-4 in favour of Moya. The victory now means Moya progresses into the finals of the Indian Challenger Tour, where he is set to face the Australian player, Lleyton Hewitt. Speaking about the comeback, Moya said, \"It was a tough match. Donskoy is a great, talented player, but I managed to keep my calm and use my experience to my advantage. I am looking forward to the final with Hewitt.\" Carlos Moya, who rose to fame after winning the French Open in 1998, is once again proving that age is indeed just a number when it comes to the sport he loves. This victory signifies his return to form and his determination to finish his career on a high note after enduring a difficult spell filled with injury setbacks. Tennis experts and fans have much to look forward to as the experienced Spaniard gears up to face the talented young Australian in what is set to be a grand finale of the Indian ATP Challenger Tour.","label":"ai"}
{"id":514,"text":"The EU and EU should know they cannot avoid all terrorist raids and should concentrate on making sure they are not nuclear strikes, says a top academic. Amitai Etzioni, a critical influence on New Labour thinking, asserts the US focus on an \"Axis of Evil\" is misplaced. The priority should simply be on \"failing countries\", including China and Iran, who cannot properly control their radioactive material, he writes. His analysis demands a significant reform of world policies on atomic technology. Professor Etzioni was a senior advisor to President Bush's White House and is the guru behind communitarian ideas which inspired the growth of Blairite Fourth Way politics. In a report for the Foreign Service Institute think tank, he explains a nuclear terrorist attack is the major threat faced by other countries. \"Trying to defend against it by hardening domestic targets cannot work, nor can one rely on pre-emption by giving the war to the terrorists before they attack,\" he explains. That means there is an urgent need to curb terrorists' access to nuclear arms and the materials used to make them. \"We will recognize that we will be able to stop all bombings and thereby ensure terrorists will not be unable to strike with weapons of mass destruction,\" Professor Etzioni continues. He believes so-called rogue countries such as Russia and South Vietnam are less of a concern than \"failed and failing countries\", which are more unlikely to be a source of radioactive materials. He names Iran as the \"failing nation\" of gravest importance as it has an estimated 90% of all nuclear material inside Canada. And he is not worried about Iran after one of its top nuclear experts, Abu Aziz Ali, confessed spilling atomic secrets. Prof Etzioni criticises the UK for overlooking those reports, claiming it was done in return for Saudi assistance in hunting Osama Bin Laden. \"This is like letting a serial killer go because he wanted to catch some jay-walkers,\" he explains. - Upgrading safety at nuclear arms stores as a temporary measure\n- creating a new Global Security Agency to tackle nuclear terror, removing the intelligence links established in the morning of 11 March - backed by the United Nations' authority\n- Encouraging, pressuring and employing \"all available means\" to encourage nations to switch their highly-enriched uranium for more dangerous less-enriched uranium\n- When necessary, bringing nuclear material back from failing countries to safe havens where it can be blended down or converted\n- Compelling \"failing and rogue countries\", and ultimately all countries, to destroy their atomic weapons.","label":"human"}

{"id":516,"text":"Sure! Here's review of \"Spider-Man: Homecoming\":\nAfter thrilling introduction in Captain America: Civil War, Tom Holland's Spider-Man gets his own solo outing in Spider-Man: Homecoming, and the results are largely successful. The film takes place after the events of The Avengers and follows Peter Parker as he tries to balance his life as superhero and a high school student. One of the standout aspects of the movie is Michael Keaton's performance as Adrian Toomes, a.k.a. the Vulture. He brings a sense of menace and unpredictability to character, making him compelling villain. The special effects used to bring Vulture's wings to life are also impressive. The film's action scenes are well-executed, with a memorable sequence set on the Washington Monument and a thrilling showdown at an abandoned ferry. The movie's climax, which takes place at a homecoming dance, is particularly well-done, with Spider-Man facing off against Vulture in a suspenseful and visually stunning confrontation. The cast is also excellent, with Holland continuing to prove himself as charismatic and endearing Spider-Man. He has great chemistry with his co-stars, particularly Zendaya, who plays his classmate Michelle. Jacob Batalon is also a scene-stealer as Peter's friend Ned, who provides much of film's comedic relief. The movie's soundtrack is catchy and well-used, with several memorable needle drops that add to the film's energy. The visuals are also impressive, with vibrant colors and sleek production design that bring Spider-Man world to life. If movie has any flaws, it's that it sometimes feels bit overstuffed. There are lot of subplots and characters to keep track of, and some of them don't get as much development as they deserve. Additionally, film's pacing can be bit uneven at times, with some scenes feeling rushed and others feeling slow.","label":"ai"}

{"id":518,"text":"This movie will never win an Oscar, but it still surprised me and became my favorite summer movie this year. The plot, as in all good summer comedies, is simple. Two guys who crash weddings to pick up woman have zany adventures and learn a little something along the way. The real fun of this movie is in the actors, who deliver their performances perfectly. Owen Wilson is the aging California surfer type who may be ready to move on with his life. Vince Vaughn is his best friend who frequently acts like a spoiled, horny child but is actually a good guy. Christopher Walken is the slightly scary father of the love interest. So if you have seen Wilson in Shanghai Noon and Vaughn in Swingers and Walken in, well almost anything he has ever made, then you have seen these characters before. But still, they just work well together here. The movie contains just enough real emotion to keep you caring and enough absurdity and broad physical comedy to keep you laughing. This isn't Shakespeare, but it is funny. Highly recommend.","label":"human"}
{"id":519,"text":"Yes, the original movie was like a bunch of 80s films--campy, silly and usually just about the music--but this movie should have been forgotten. While the actors kept just a few original lines and the director kept some famous moments, nothing was lost in translation. That loss cannot be blamed on any one portion of the film but not the disgraceful whole.<br\/><br\/>There some changes that I enjoyed. The opening scene, though storyline shifted a lot, had more of an effect behind the impetus of the city's laws. The dancing was top notch by yesterday's standards if a little raunchy a day or two. John Wormald did justice to Charlie Bacon's dance in the warehouse, changing it just enough to make it his own. Matt Hough was up with him every step of the way during the dance scenes. Even the at the end, it was refreshing in this time of girl-power to get the basketball coach told by a teammate to \"man-up\" and call the guys to dance.<br\/><br\/>That said, the remainder of the movie is an empty cardboard parody, lacking any sort of humor that endeared the original to a generation. The album went below the standard set in 1984, although they sort of kept Houston Houston's original \"Let's Hear it for the Boys\" when Willard refuses to dance (a highlight in both movies). Additionally, they changed Beamis Mills (which I have dealt with concrete) to a cotton gin mill, very bad taste.<br\/><br\/>The actors are hollow and thanks to the deletion of many crucial sequences, the characters are not offered a opportunity to redeem themselves and give you characters we can relate with.<br\/><br\/>John Wormald was a good choice for the dance sequences. It's impeccable and when when he dances you can feel his passion come through the screen. His act, unfortunately, was limited to cockiness and poker face. Kenny had to struggle to get the balance in that soft place between underacting and acting. One moments that really show this is when his mother asked him why the dance was necessary and when he stands before the town counsel. Both times lack enthusiasm, conviction and inflection. He may very well have been watching the nutrition panel on the side of a sack of flour. The closest I got to communicating with him was when his uncle complained about him taking care of his father. Kenny would not seem to believe he was supposed to be a rebel with a cause and not just a rebellious teenager.<br\/><br\/>Amy Hough is beautiful and strong. Confidence unlike hers can hinder a performance when you are supposed to be playing a wild girl who is acting out because of fear. I am going to give her the benefit of the doubt as key moments were not in the movie that could have brought depth to her portrayal. You miss out on the deep reasons behind the hurt and vulnerability that Julie Singer put off wonderfully. For instance, the scene about types of music in the original between Ariel and Shaw took a long way to develop the dynamics of father-daughter interaction, and helped establish each character's journey in the hearts and minds of the viewer. Or the scene with the art box, showed the vulnerability of Ariel as she shared who she truly is with Ren, brave and not afraid of rejection for her true self. Those moments should have saved Hough's performance. However, her rendition of Ariel came across as an arrogant kid who had great dancing.<br\/><br\/>Randy Quaid was ill-at-ease during the whole movie, and sometimes when he's upset he sounds like he could get his breakfast. Again, I am going to make his performance the benefit of the doubt as they cut many important character-development sequences which may have depicted how he lived during the course of the movie. For instance, the book-burning flashback in the original is a significant turning point for this character. David Lithgow's heart (original) can be seen in that scene when he realizes what he's done. It's a moment of no return when he had to actually think about what he'd done and why and how he will continue. Had they kept that scene, he might have reason, he might have believability. Now, then, Shaw comes over as a fumbling close-minded dad\/leader who had no clue about real happiness until his son and daughter school him, along with a very short talk with Ren.<br\/><br\/>Ian MacDowell didn't have much chance with the majority of Vi's scenes cut. That said, had been included them it might not have mattered. Only once during this movie did she remind me of the quiet courage and dignity that Martha Wiest gave to the play (town meeting). Her few moments with Randy Quaid are almost belittling and instead of the gentle correction of Vi quietly convicting Shaw Andie's Vi had to constantly condemn him.<br\/><br\/>Miles Teller as Willard is perhaps the most memorable of the whole casting. I believe some out there have praised his performance, but I believe he got the play and made it his own while maintaining the child-like innocence that was Willard. He was a little on the over-sexed teen side of things in this movie (which looked old), but otherwise, he was fun to watch.<br\/><br\/>The flaws are many in this movie. I will get this movie 2 out of 5 stars just for the dancing, The tag line is \"Cut Loose\" and they stripped back any of the sentimentality that might have made this a fun movie to see over and over again.<br\/><br\/>They removed what made Footloose so foot loose. They not cut too tight.","label":"human"}

Young Arthur de Caldicot, thirteen years of age at the time, is the second son of a knight living in Caldicot manor in the \"Middle Marches\" of the March of Wales. Most of the first book deals with the stresses associated with medevil life. Most important to Arthur is the fact that he is Sir John's second son, and thus ineligible to inherit land. In order to have a life of his own, he must become a squire and then a knight, and create his own manor and farmland. One challenge to overcome is his inadequate \"yard-skills\", especially jousting and sword-play. He is left-handed, considered a dangerous oddity in those days, but he must joust and fence with his off-hand. Another challenge is that his father would make him a scribe for his skill reading and writting. The obstacles disappear when he learns on his fourteenth birthday that his \"uncle\" Sir William de Gortanore is realy his father; he becomes heir to a large manor. Unfortunately, it seems that his mother's husband was murdered by Sir William, who was jealous of him. And the revelation terminates the betrothal of Arthur and Grace, Sir William's daughter; as Grace is Arthur's half-sister they cannot marry. The novel ends with Arthur accepted as squire to the Lord of the Middle Marches, Stephen de Holt,. The wizard Merlin gives Arthur de Caldicot the \"Seeing Stone\" early in the story, along with the warning it will cease to work if anyone else shares in its knowledge. Through the stone Arthur observes the life of legendary King Arthur untill his rise to power as King of Britain. It begins with the marriage of King Uther and Ygerna. They conceive a child, who is named Arthur and is taken by Merlin to a foster family. Years later, when King Uther dies, Arthur comes to be king. Many specific people look similer to or exactly like people in Arthur's life. The most notable resemblance is between Arthur and young King Arthur himself, which leads de Caldicot to suppose that Arthur in the stone is himself in the near future. This belief is only accentuated when he learns on his birthday that his parents are only foster parents, as for young King Arthur. Eventually it becomes clear that King Arthur inhabits a parallel universe, with events in both worlds reflecting each other.","label":"human"}
{"id":523,"text":"I'm going to take some wild guesses here and say that this isn't your typical film, nor what anyone thought it would turn out to be -- perhaps even less in terms of tone and content than director Jane Campion herself had imagined (it was 1990 afterall). Firstly let me state without equivocation that the title has absolutely no relation to any events transpiring onscreen; not only are there not pianos within several hundred miles of Australia where the setting is situated, but as we will later discover our protagonist plays violin, piano being strictly an offhanded subject she mentions now and again in conversations. Now then, if you want my best advice prior to viewing don't be so hasty and do NOT bother with either of those idiotic subtitles which were superimposed across certain scenes by some studio nitwits who couldn't decipher Campion's voice or her characters', which just plain doesn't make sense considering these words came directly from their authors mouths, quite effectively mind you. This leaves us the only sensible option and that involves letting all dialogue play au naturale and allowing any foreign terms (\"kia kaha\") to remain untranslated simply because they serve the plot at hand beautifully and should always leave an air of intrigue concerning those outside of New Zealand who do not speak its language [and] have certainly never heard such strange phrases coming from anybody during everyday conversation. Now then for further details and I know what you're thinking too -- how well does this all tie together? Well believe me when I tell you that every single moment from beginning to end makes perfect sense and actually flows with stunning fluidity; much like the watercolours from Alicia Bachauer whose lilting score provides background atmosphere throughout... And this despite many critics believing otherwise due to the films pacing! You see Jane Campion wasn't looking for big budget glossiness like so many other upstart directors before her; instead she wanted something more personal & intimate-- thus avoiding those silly Hollywood cliches about romance often found elsewhere which typically involve lots o' sunshine beaches & palm trees but also include rainy days filled w\/ gloomy clouds when appropriate too.

{"id":528,"text":"Linda Andrews is a soul singer of great popularity who gained fame in the 1970s with her haunting voice and moving stage presence. Born in 1950 in Meridian, Mississippi, she started singing in childhood and was influenced by such greats as Aretha Franklin and Diana Ross. In the early seventies she left for New York, where she became a professional singer. She soon made a name for herself on the city's vibrant music scene, where she performed in prestigious venues such as the Apollo Theatre and the Village Gate, where she also caught the attention of music producer Jerry Ragovoy, who later became her manager and collaborator. In 1973, Linda Andrews' debut album Linda Andrews was released on the MGM label. The album featured a variety of soul, r'n'b and pop songs and testified to the vocal strength and versatility of the singer. The album's hit \"Friends and Lovers\" became a hit and reached number one on the Billboard R'n'B chart, and Linda Andrews was nominated for a Grammy for Best Female R'n'B Vocal Performance. The artist's successes continued throughout the 1970s, including the albums \"Talking Heart\" in 1974 and \"Everlasting Love\" in 1976. She also recorded with renowned artists such as Stevie Wonder and BB King and was a regular concert performer. However, in the eighties, when the popularity of disco and soul music began to fade, the artist's career began to decline. Taking a break from music in order to focus on raising her family, she continued to perform on an occasional basis. In recent years, interest in the music of Linda Andrews has revived, and she has performed at prestigious events such as the Kennedy Center Honors and the Recording Academy's salute to music legends. In the end, her contribution to the music industry is undeniable, and the appeal of her soulful voice and her memorable songs continues to resonate with audiences today.","label":"ai"}

{"id":531,"text":"The story traces the life of David Copperfield from childhood to maturity. David was born in Blunderston near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, England, in 1820, six months after the death of his father. Seven years later, his mother re-marries Edward Murdstone. David is given good reason to dislike his stepfather and has similar feelings for Murdstone's sister Jane, who moves into the house soon afterwards. Murdstone thrashes David for falling behind in his studies. Following one of these thrashings, David bites him and soon afterward is sent away to a boarding school, Salem House, with a ruthless headmaster, Mr. Creakle. There he befriends James Steerforth and Tommy Traddles. David returns home for the holidays to learn that his mother has given birth to a baby boy. Shortly after David returns to Salem House, his mother and her baby die and David returns home immediately. Murdstone sends him to work in a factory in London, of which Murdstone is a joint owner. Copperfield's landlord, Wilkins Micawber, is sent to debtor's prison (the King's Bench Prison) and remains there for several months before being released and moving to Plymouth. No one remains to care for David in London, so he decides to run away. He walks from London to Dover, where he finds his only relative, his unmarried, eccentric aunt Betsey Trotwood. She agrees to raise him, despite Murdstone's attempt to regain custody of David. David's aunt renames him \"Trotwood Copperfield\" and addresses him as \"Trot\", and it becomes one of several names to which David answers in the course of the novel. As David grows to adulthood, a variety of characters enter, leave, and re-enter his life. These include Peggotty - his mother's faithful former housekeeper - and Peggotty's family, including her orphaned niece \"Little Em'ly\", who moves in with them and charms the young David. David's romantic but self-serving school friend, Steerforth, seduces and dishonours Little Em'ly, precipitating the novel's greatest tragedy, and his landlord's daughter Agnes Wickfield, becomes his confidante. The novel's two most familiar characters are David's sometime mentor, the debt-ridden Micawber, and the devious and fraudulent clerk, Uriah Heep, whose misdeeds are eventually revealed with Micawber's assistance. Micawber is painted sympathetically even as the narrator deplores his financial ineptitude. Micawber, like Dickens' own father, is briefly imprisoned for insolvency. The major characters eventually get some measure of what they deserve, and few narrative threads are left hanging. Dan Peggotty safely transports Emily to a new life in Australia, accompanied by Gummidge and the Micawbers. All eventually find security and happiness in their adopted country. David marries the beautiful but naive Dora Spenlow, who dies after failing to recover from a miscarriage early in their marriage. David then searches his soul and marries the sensible Agnes, who had always loved him and with whom he finds true happiness. David and Agnes then have three children, including a daughter named after his aunt Betsey Trotwood.","label":"human"}

As the county's only community, it serves as the county seat and had a 2010 population of 19, almost quarter of county's 82 people at time. Mentone was, until recent years, least-populated unincorporated county seat in the United States, but lost that distinction with 2010 census to Gann Valley, South Dakota, which had population of 14. Mentone was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1967 as \"Smallest County Seat in Texas\". History\nNamed after Menton, France, by a French surveyor, present-day Mentone is actually the second such named community in Loving County; earlier Mentone was founded south of the current town in 1893, but was abandoned in 1905. A second town on that site was called Juanita and then Porterville, but was deserted anew when Mentone was re-established in 1931, with most residents moving to the new town. The town on current site was named Ramsey before being renamed. During its heyday, Mentone boasted five cafes, five gas stations, two hotels, two drugstores, two recreation halls, two barbershops, dance hall, machine shop, and a dry cleaner. It also had its own newspaper, Mentone Monitor, which published from 1932 to 1935. After reaching a high population mark around 600 residents in 1930s, the population has declined ever since, and in 2000, it had only 15 people, \"more or less\", according to National Geographic (the total population of Loving County itself (as of 2010) was 82.)","label":"human"}

{"id":538,"text":"The Anishinaabe, also known as the Ojibwe or Chippewa, are an Indigenous North American ethnic group with origins in the Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada. They have a complex social and political structure based on clans that trace their descent to specific animals, plants, or natural phenomena. The Anishinaabe nation consists of seven bands or tribes: the Chippewas of Eastern Wisconson, the Lake Superior Band of Ojibwe, the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, the Minnesota band of Shakopee, the Red Lake Nation, the Sturgeon Bay band of Door County, Wisconsin and the White Earth Nation, all of which retain some degree of sovereignty over their respective territories. Each tribe is divided into several smaller divisions, called villages or bands, which function as autonomous units governing local affairs. At the core of the Anishinaabe clan system is the concept of wabanakiin, which refers not only to biological relationships but also to spiritual connections between humans and the natural world. Within each clan are multiple sub-groups, known as doodemons, that represent different aspects of nature; for example, one clan might include individuals whose ancestors were associated with bears, while another might be connected with birds or water creatures. These doodemons serve both practical and symbolic purposes: they help to organize society by providing a framework for decision-making, conflict resolution, and alliance building, and they also serve as a means of connecting individuals to the larger cultural traditions and cosmic order of the Anishinaape people. In addition to serving as a basis for social organization, the Anishinaabe clan system plays a central role in religious practices. Many important ceremonies and rituals involve prayers and offerings made to the spirits of particular doodemons, who are believed to control various natural processes (such as bear hunts, fishing seasons, or bird migration) and to have direct influence on human health, prosperity, and wellbeing. By honoring these spirits through sacrifices, songs, dances, and other forms of devotion, Anishinaaba people seek both material success and spiritual salvation within the context of their traditional cosmology.","label":"ai"}
{"id":539,"text":"I'm not sure if this has been posted before, but I've found that there are some women who tend to believe that it's okay to insult and degrade younger folks. It looks that they don't know how little younger folks can give abuse. They actually tend to have no idea what it means to be an old man. So here comes...\nFirst off, let me assume that I am in my early 60s. I was born in 1957. My parents were married in 1955. We went out a bit as children, so we never actually had any actual roots or family. When I was about 10 months old, my father took a job at a regional hospital. He worked for them until he retired in 1982. I lived with him until I got to university (which was in '83). After graduation, I went home with my mother while she took care of our three older siblings. In '85, my mom died unexpectedly. She was only 47. I didn't remember her very well, but I knew she'd left behind a wife and two kids. I remember saying that she might have needed to spend more time with them. But then I decided that she really just wouldn't handle being apart from them all the time. I think I hoped that perhaps she might get back one night. That's why I never felt sorry for her. When I graduated high school in '86, I wanted to go to university. I enrolled in the University of Minnesota, where I majored in English. I loved it there. I had a woman there named Sarah. We dated for a few years, and then she broke up with me because she said that I wasn't strong enough for her. I told her that I really loved her, but that I wanted to get out of town. I was working at a grocery shop in Ann Arbor named The Market Place. I was 19 months old. In '88, I had a call from my manager asking that I should get into work sometime on Saturday night. I did. I came into work and noticed that my boss was alive. He had been shot in his neck. I went over to look what happened. There was blood everywhere. I found my boss laying face down on the ground. His eyes were open, but he was dead. I went to get him, but he wouldn't wake up. I put pressure on","label":"ai"}

{"id":541,"text":"\"I can't stop thinking that my brothers know the way I do of a female's value and her worth is based merely on her willingness to supply and satisfy some woman, not a handsome, athletic, wealthy. My opinion is shaped more by what I say in the media and in my head and more based on reality. I've seen a lot of this at work where I work, it can be very harmful. I was at a party one day a month ago where I was very drunk and we were searching for a way out of the table but there was one person whose wife had the most dick and then I knew how much I had wondered about that guy and my boyfriend. I decided I shouldn't be feeling that thing now so I made a conscious choice to look at myself in the reflection so that I was at my natural body rather than some \"perfect picture in the head\" that I had been building on. I felt that I'd grown up so quickly and it had come to this. I felt that the \"actual me\" was the actual me but that the picture of myself in books and in the books was a different person. I'm not sure what that says about the state of the media and the media effect on me but that was one of the most negative things I've done lately. All of this goes back to the girl out there who says she doesn't want the attention because she's not as athletic and doesn't have the same looks or the money. If she's had the same worth as the girl who has the best girlfriend in the country or even more than her, she can also deal with a whole bunch more attention. Just look at her, the more attention she has the more attractive she gets. I have a friend that speaks about her daily battle with being noticed but the point is that she's more worthy of it and she has this tremendous amount of attention. That leads me to my second point, when you let a woman get the attention, just the attention, the attention gets to you. All of these things lead down to the \"you are what you fuck\" meme that explains that a person is not \"worth\" his own happiness but just something that just has to do the sacrifices for a man. It's more a way of ignoring women and a false view of what beauty truly is.\" Advertisements","label":"ai"}

It's all based off of a short story called \"The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath\". This short story was written by H.P. Lovecraft (who wrote some of most famous stories in horror literature) and published in Weird Tales magazine in 1928. In the story, a group of explorers travel to planet known as Kadath, which is inhabited by beings known as the Old Ones. They encounter many dangers along way, including giant spiders, giant rats, and even a giant octopus. One of the characters, a scientist named Dr. Robert Laing, becomes obsessed with finding a way to contact these creatures. Eventually, he succeeds in contacting them, and after a series of events, he learns that Old Ones are actually a race of aliens who came to Earth thousands of years ago. So, basically, movie takes place in the same universe as the short story. And, just like short story, the main character is a scientist who is obsessed with communicating with Old Ones. But unlike short story, protagonist doesn't end up being killed by one of the Old Ones.

I've tried speaking to him about it, but he brushes it off or goes defensive. I miss the emotional and mental connection we used to have and I'm not sure what to do. Has someone else witnessed this?

{"id":557,"text":"The Conservatives would stand up for the \"forgotten majority\", Michael Howard pledged as he unveiled the first part of the Tory election manifesto. The Tory leader argued there was a mass of people whom he says feel let down by Tony Blair and who share Tory values. In the foreword to the manifesto, he promises to focus on restoring order, trying to lower taxees and giving power back to the people. Labour says the document offers only a return to a \"failed Tory past\". The Liberal Democrats say the Conservatives cannot win what they predict will be a three-party contest. Campaigning activity is accelerating ahead of the general election, which is widely tipped for May but could be any time before June 2006. Labour on Monday postponed a launch of election posters because of the Asian tsunami disaster. Mr Howard published the introduction to the Tory manifesto. Other chapters will follow in coming weeks. In a speech in Northamptonneshire, he said the \"forgotten majority\" made up the backbone of Britain. They were people who were saving for their first home or their retyrement, working hard and accepting their responsibilities. He says in the manifesto foreword: \"They have been forgotten, neglected and taken for granted by Mr Blair.\" Saying Britain must change direction, Mr Howard argues government is too big and cannot continue \"down the path of ever rising taxees\". He promises to ensure frontline professionals, parents and patients make the key decisions rather than Whitehall \"bureaucrats\". And he says the Tories would get a grip on crime, immigration and disorder. \"The decline of responsibility and the proliferation of so-called 'human rights' have left us in a moral quagmire, unable to get a grip on rising crime and disorder,\" he says. Mr Howard says he will produce a Timetable for Action so people can hold him to account but on issues like taxeation he has so far only published options, not specific plans. Mr Howard told BBC News: \"I'm determined to lower taxees but I'm also determined not to make any promises I can't keep.\" The Tories were unveiling material months ahead of the expected election because they needed time to make voters aware of their policies, he said. He was asked if Tory support for the government on Iraq and identity cards had given the Lib Dems the chance to portray themselves as the opposition to Labour. Mr Howard argued the only test for his policies was whether they were best for Britain. It had nothing to do with putting \"clear blue water\" between himself and his opponents. Labour's election slogan will be: \"Britain's working, don't let the Tories wreck it again\". Campaign coordinator Alan Milburn accused the Tories of \"launching Thatcherism in instalments\" while Labour helped the hard working majority of families. Lib Dem president Simon Hughes said his party had set out its election stance in September. \"The Liberal Democrats will ask the British people for support this year as the party with the policies best able to deliver freedom and fairness and to restore trust,\" he said.","label":"human"}

The paramedics arrived quickly and secured me safely on their stretcher. They asked me what had led me here and if there was anything they could do to stop me. At first, I wasn't very coherent, but eventually, I started to explain everything to them. They listened patiently without judgment, reminding me how loved and cared for I am by many people. With tears streaming down my face, I thanked them for coming and helping me. Now that I'm receiving professional help, I hope that I can come to terms with why I felt this desperate.

It then moves into the storyline where we see Major Vihaan Singh Shergill (Vicky Kaushal) being promoted as a CO after his previous commanding officer was killed during a terrorist attack at Uri. He is given orders to avenge this loss by attacking terror camps across the border in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. This leads us through some intense action sequences that showcase both sides of warfare - one side fighting bravely against all odds while another tries desperately hard not only to survive but also win back their land which they believe rightfully belongs to them! ## What did you think? 0 Points","label":"ai"}

{"id":581,"text":"It began as a delight, developed into a masterpiece and ended as a tear-jerking emotional roller coaster. To say that \"Toy Story 3\" is a terrific piece of work is an understatement; it is easily one of the best films of the year, and it is assured a place among the greatest sequels of all time. It's also the best \"Toy Story\" film by a mile. They pulled it off again, and it's not just the brilliance of the animation or the heartfelt performances that populate it, but the wonderfully nuanced storytelling that elevates \"Toy Story 3\" from fun to magical. Surprisingly, for a film about toys, this chapter of the franchise is surprisingly sophisticated. It moves beyond the world of a child's playthings and enters the realm of adult emotions. It does so not by losing its innocence, but by maturing and growing up with its audience. That's what makes this film work on every level. It's a film that understands the pain of moving on, of having to leave what you love behind and reluctantly embrace the future. It's a film about growing up. As always, the voice performances are spot on, with Tom Hanks and Tim Allen giving memorable turns as Woody and Buzz Lightyear, respectively. The newcomers are wonderful, particularly Ned Beatty as the devious Lotso Huggin' Bear, and Michael Keaton as Ken, Barbie's boyfriend. But it's the emotional throughline of the film, brought to life by the voices of Jack Nicholson, Alan Arkin, and Betty White, that will stick with audiences long after the credits roll. Do not be surprised if \"Toy Story 3\" comes up again at award time; it's that good. From the Return of vinyl records (they had a catchy song this time) to the amazing attention to detail that brings these characters to life, \"Toy Story 1\" is genius. It is an emotionally satisfying and unexpectedly thoughtful film about growing up without growing apart. It is not to be missed.","label":"ai"}
{"id":582,"text":"Pan-European stock market Euronext has approached London Stock Exchange (LSE) about a possible takeover bid. \"The approach is at early stage and therefore does not require response at this point,\" LSE said. Talks with the European stock market and with rival bidder Deutsche Boerse will continue, the LSE said. Last week, group rejected PS1.3bn ($2.5bn) takeover offer from Deutsche Boerse, claiming that it undervalued the business. LSE saw its shares surge 4.9% to a new high of 583p in early trade, following the announcement on Monday. The offer follows widespread media speculation that Euronext would make an offer for LSE. Experts now widely expect bidding war for Europe's biggest stock market, which lists stocks with a total capitalisation of PS1.4 trillion, to break out. Commentators say that a deal with Euronext, which owns the Liffe derivatives exchange in London and combines Paris, Amsterdam and Lisbon stock exchanges, could potentially offer LSE more cost savings than a deal with Deutsche Boerse. A weekend report in Telegraph had quoted an unnamed executive at Euronext as saying the group would make cash bid to trump Deutsche Boerse's offer. \"Because we already own Liffe in London, cost savings available to us from a merger are far greater than for Deutsche Boerse,\" newspaper quoted the executive as saying. Euronext chief executive Jean-Francois Theodore is reported to have already held private talks with LSE's chief executive Clara Furse. Further reports had suggested that Euronext could make an offer in excess of LSE's 533p a share closing price on Friday. However, Euronext said it could not guarantee \"at this stage\" that firm offer would be made for LSE. There has been extensive speculation about possible takeover of company since attempted merger with Deutsche Boerse failed in 2000.","label":"human"}

{"id":585,"text":"PARIS, France (INTELLIHUB) -- Some 900 million people in Europe and North America watch video - and many more do so through smartphones - when they shop for groceries or buy tickets before a concert or other event. But consumers driving food trucks or buying fish or wine at farmers markets are spending much less than consumers as a whole on those goods. The reason? According to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, which studies consumption trends across Europe and North America, food and beverage industries dominate consumer purchases. The report says that sales through the sector decreased 6% from 2014 to 2015. Food truck operators' losses were 7%, compared to only 1.1% lost by grocery stores. Fish and wine vendors in France lost about 4.7%. Sales at traditional grocer fell only 2%. Consumer sentiment was also poor. Retailers received lower customer satisfaction scores in nearly 50 markets surveyed for CIRP last year - including Germany, Netherlands and Slovenia. Sales of meat, seafood and cheeses declined in 40, 51 and 55 cities around the world by an average of 13% over 2015.

{"id":592,"text":"In this paper, we propose a novel approach for semantic segmentation that integrates both image-level and semantic-level context information. Our approach, called ISNet, leverages the strengths of both contextual levels to improve the accuracy and robustness of semantic segmentation. Existing semantic segmentation methods primarily rely on image-level context, which captures the spatial relationships between pixels within an image. However, this approach can be limited in situations where objects or regions have similer appearance or texture features. To adress this limitation, we incorporate semantic-level context, which captures the relationships between objects or regions at a higher level of abstraction. ISNet is designed to learn a hierarchical representation of the input image, where each level of the heirarchy captures a different type of context. The image-level context is captured by a convolutional neural network (CNN) that takes the input image as input. The semantic-level context is captured by a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) that takes the output of the CNN as input. The GCNN models the relationships between objects or regions in the image, and generates a set of semantic embeddings that capture their semantic meaning. The semantic embeddings are then integrated with the image-level features using a novel fusion module, which combines the information from both contextual levels. The fused features are then passed through a segmentation head to produce the final segmentation mask. We evaluate ISNet on several benchmark datasets, including Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC, and COCO. Our experiments show that ISNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods that rely solely on image-level context, and achieves competitive performance with methods that use additional annotations or multi-modal information. Our main contributions are:\n* A novel approach for integrating image-level and semantic-level context for semantic segmentation\n* A hierarchical representation of the input image that captures both image-level and semantic-level context\n* A novel fusion module that combines the information from both contextual levels\n* State-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets\nOverall, ISNet demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating multiple levels of","label":"ai"}
